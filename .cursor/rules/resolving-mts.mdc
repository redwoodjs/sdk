description: When importing from `.mts` source files, use the `.mjs` extension in the import path. TypeScript will handle the resolution. Not though that the actual file extensions will be `.mts` though - it is only for TypeScript's benefit that the specifiers are `.mjs` in imports, even though the file extensions of the actual files are in fact `.mts`.
