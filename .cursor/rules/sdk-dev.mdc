- Note that the monorepo dir might share the same name as the package dir for the sdk. Any code written or changed for the sdk package should go underneath the `sdk/` subdirectory.
  - e.g. `<repo_dir>/sdk/src/runtime/worker.tsx`
  - e.g. if `<repo_dir>` name is `sdk`, then an example path would be: `sdk/sdk/src/runtime/worker.tsx`
  - Runtime code is situated at `<repo_dir>/sdk/src/runtime/`
  - Code for the vite plugin is situated at `<repo_dir>/sdk/src/vite/`
- Look at the other filenames in the same directory to determine whether to use camelCase or kebab-case. When in doubt, use camel case.
- When importing from `.mts` source files, use the `.mjs` extension in the import path. TypeScript will handle the resolution. **Note** the real file extensions on disk will be `.mts` - it is only for TypeScript's benefit that the import specifiers are `.mjs` in imports, even though the file extensions of the actual files are in fact `.mts`.
- Playground examples are self-contained, runnable projects located in the playground/ directory, designed to demonstrate and test RedwoodSDK features. Each example, modeled after playground/hello-world, must include an __tests__ directory with end-to-end tests. These tests are executed from the monorepo root; refer to the "End-to-End Tests (Playground)" section in CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed instructions and API documentation. For context on using the framework to build playgroud examples refer to our docs in docs/src/content/docs. Run the tests from monorepo root, `e.g: pnpm test:e2e -- playground/hello-world/__tests__/e2e.test.mts`
- For context on contribution guidelines and dev workflow commands, refer to CONTRIBUTING.md in the repo root. 
- In tests, avoid mocking (e.g. `vi.mock()`), prefer depending injection, see CONTRIBUTING.md for more context
- For context on how the system works, refer to the architecture documentation located in the `docs/architecture` directory.
- If making changes to the way the system works that would affect the architecture documentation, revise the documentation to keep it up to date
- When changing architecture documentation
  - Make sure the document is understandable without prior context
  - Keep a coherent narrative - start with the challenge(s) so that the user has context on the _why_'s that informed the solution, before explaining the solution.
  - Keep it high level - do not mention identifiers in the code unless it is accompanied by a simplified code example for conceptual understanding of their purpose
- Playground end-to-end tests use Puppeteer for browser automation. Use Puppeteer's API (`page.waitForSelector`, `page.evaluate`, etc.) for all test interactions and assertions. To avoid flaky tests from stale element references, always re-select an element from the DOM just before you interact with it (e.g., inside a helper function). Before simulating user interactions, wait for the page to be fully interactive by using `page.waitForFunction('document.readyState === "complete"')` to ensure client-side hydration is finished. For async assertions, use the `poll` utility instead of arbitrary timeouts.
