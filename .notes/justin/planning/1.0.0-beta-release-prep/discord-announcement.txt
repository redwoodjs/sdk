@everyone

We're excited to announce that we've just published the first beta release for RedwoodSDK v1.0.0!

You can get started now by running:
```
npx create-rwsdk my-app
```

For existing users on a `0.x` version, we've prepared a detailed migration guide to walk you through the upgrade process:
https://docs.rwsdk.com/getting-started/migrating

Here are a few of the notable changes:
* **Simpler Project Scaffolding**: We've replaced the `standard` and `minimal` templates with a single, unified `starter`. This provides a clean foundation for all projects, with authentication now available as an optional, version-locked Passkey addon.
* **Improved Hydration and Streaming**: We've re-architected our server-side rendering to fix `useId` hydration mismatches
* **UI Library Examples**: We've added a `playground` with end-to-end tested examples, includes ones for key features and popular libraries, showcasing our support for shadcn/ui (Radix), Base UI, and Chakra UI.
* **Consistent Middleware**: RSC Actions now run through the same global middleware pipeline as page requests, allowing for consistent authentication and session logic.

We look forward to your feedback as we move towards the full 1.0 release.
