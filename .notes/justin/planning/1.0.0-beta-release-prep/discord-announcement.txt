@everyone

We've just published the first beta release for RedwoodSDK v1.0.0.

You can get started with the beta by running:
`npx create-rwsdk@beta my-app`

This release is the result of many alpha versions and includes significant updates to the framework's architecture and features.

For existing users on a `0.x` version, please consult the migration guide for instructions on how to upgrade:

Some of the notable changes include a shift to a peer dependency model, unified middleware handling for RSC Actions, and improvements to streaming and hydration.
