**Fix:** The solution is to normalize the `cacheFolder` path to use forward slashes, which are universally accepted in YAML files, regardless of the operating system. I will modify the path string before it's written to the file.

### 2. Cross-Platform Environment Variables in `package.json`

**Issue:** The `release` script in the `starter` and all `playground` examples used `RWSDK_DEPLOY=1 wrangler deploy` to signal a production build to the Redwood plugin. This syntax for setting environment variables is not cross-platform and fails on Windows with shells like PowerShell or Command Prompt.

**Investigation:** My first thought was to introduce a dependency like `cross-env` to handle this. However, this would add a new dependency to user projects and felt like a workaround rather than a fundamental solution.

We then explored several alternatives to remove the need for the environment variable altogether:
-   **Using `process.argv`**: This was quickly dismissed as too brittle, as it depends on how Vite is invoked.
-   **Using Vite's `configResolved` hook**: This was also incorrect because the `dev:init` script needs to run *before* other plugins are instantiated, and this hook runs too late in the lifecycle.
-   **Exporting a function from `vite.config.mts`**: This is the idiomatic Vite way to handle command-dependent configuration. It would work but would constitute a significant breaking change for all existing users, forcing them to update their `vite.config.mts` files.

**Solution:** The most elegant and backward-compatible solution came from realizing we could rely on the `NODE_ENV` variable that Vite itself sets very early in its process.

-   Vite sets `NODE_ENV` to `'production'` for builds.
-   Vite sets `NODE_ENV` to `'development'` for the dev server.

This aligns perfectly with our desired behavior: we want to run `dev:init` in any development context, and skip it in any production context. Using `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` as our condition is more accurate and robust than our previous `RWSDK_DEPLOY` flag. It correctly handles the default cases and also respects any user overrides of `NODE_ENV`.

This change is backward-compatible. For existing users who have `RWSDK_DEPLOY=1` in their scripts, the variable will simply be ignored by the plugin. However, for Windows users, the build was already broken; they will need to remove the variable from their `release` script to get the fix, which is a reasonable expectation. This will be noted for the pull request description.
