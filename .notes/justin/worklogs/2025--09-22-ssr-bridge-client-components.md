### Refinement: Virtualizing the Barrel File Import

**Problem:**
While the barrel file correctly consolidates vendor dependencies for `optimizeDeps`, the import to the barrel file itself (`import VENDOR_BARREL from "rwsdk/__vendor_client_barrel"`) is a standard import. This breaks the SSR subgraph model, which requires all modules intended for the `ssr` environment to be loaded via the `virtual:rwsdk:ssr:` prefix.

**Solution:**
The import path to the vendor barrel file must also be prefixed with `virtual:rwsdk:ssr:`.

-   **Change:** The generated import will be updated from `import VENDOR_BARREL from "rwsdk/__vendor_client_barrel"` to `import VENDOR_BARREL from "virtual:rwsdk:ssr:rwsdk/__vendor_client_barrel"`.

This ensures that the barrel file itself is loaded through the `ssrBridgePlugin`, keeping the entire dependency graph for vendor client modules correctly contained within the SSR subgraph during development.
