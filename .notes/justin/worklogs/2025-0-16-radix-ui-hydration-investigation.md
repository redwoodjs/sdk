The fix involves two parts:
1.  **Modify `PreambleExtractor`**: The extractor was updated to capture *all* content from the very beginning of the stream up to the `</head>` tag. This ensures the `resumableState` script is captured regardless of its position.
2.  **Modify `assembleHtmlStreams`**: The stream assembly logic was updated to replace the entire `<head>...</head>` section of the user's `Document` with the newly captured (and correct) preamble from React's shell.

This change fixed the malformed HTML and the extraction logic, but the root cause of the empty preamble remained.

## 23. The Final Insight: Providing Context to React's Renderer

Even with the corrected extractor, the preamble was still empty. The final realization was that React's `renderToReadableStream` function was not generating the `resumableState` because the component being rendered (`RscApp`) was too minimal. It seems React requires some asset context (like stylesheets or preload links) to be present in the shell it renders to trigger the serialization of its internal hydration state.

The definitive solution was to modify the `RscApp` component within `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream` to include the framework's `Stylesheets` and `Preloads` components in its `<head>`. This provided the necessary context for React to generate the `resumableState` script, which the `PreambleExtractor` could then correctly capture and the `assembleHtmlStreams` function could inject into the final document. This resolved the `useId` hydration mismatch.
