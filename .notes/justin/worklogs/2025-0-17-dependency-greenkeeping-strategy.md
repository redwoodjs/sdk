The temporary and now-obsolete GitHub Action workflow files will be deleted from this branch.

### Step 11: Correcting the Pointer Syntax

After installing the Renovate App and creating the pointer configuration on `main`, Renovate produced an error: `Cannot find preset's package (github>redwoodjs/sdk:greenkeep-now-and-ongoing)`.

**Finding:**

The syntax used in the pointer `renovate.json` on the `main` branch was incorrect. A colon (`:`) is used to specify a file path within a repository's default branch. To reference a configuration on a different branch, a hash (`#`) must be used to specify the git ref.

**Action:**

The pointer `renovate.json` on the `main` branch must be corrected to use the `#` syntax. The correct configuration is:
`{ "extends": ["github>redwoodjs/sdk#greenkeep-now-and-ongoing"] }`

This change will allow the Renovate App to correctly locate and apply the configuration from our feature branch.

### Step 12: Refining Grouping Rules

The Renovate App successfully ran but produced more individual PRs than expected, indicating a problem with the grouping rules.

**Finding:**

An analysis of the "Dependency Dashboard" issue created by Renovate revealed three issues:
1.  A conflicting `packageRules` entry was explicitly excluding `@cloudflare/workers-types` from one group, preventing it from being included in the main `cloudflare` group.
2.  The `config:recommended` preset was separating major version updates into their own PRs by default.
3.  There were no rules to handle dependencies outside of the `sdk/` and `starters/` directories (e.g., in `docs/` or the root `package.json`), causing them to generate individual PRs.

**Action:**

The `renovate.json` configuration has been updated to address these findings:
1.  The conflicting exclusion for `@cloudflare/workers-types` has been removed.
2.  `separateMajorMinor: false` has been added to the root of the configuration to keep major updates within their defined groups.
3.  A new "catch-all" rule has been added to the end of the `packageRules` array. This rule will group all previously unmatched dependencies into a single weekly "repository-maintenance" PR.
