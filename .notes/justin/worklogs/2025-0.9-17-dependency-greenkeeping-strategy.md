### Step 2: Reproduce the Failure

I updated the `devDependencies` in both `starters/minimal/package.json` and `starters/standard/package.json` to the following versions, which were reported to cause failures:
The smoke tests for both starters failed with the exact error reported by users: `Error: Build failed with 1 error: error: Must use "outdir" when there are multiple input files`. This confirms that our smoke test suite is effective at catching this type of regression.

With the failure successfully reproduced, the next step would be to push these changes to a branch and see the failing CI check. After that, a maintainer could use the newly created `Pin Dependency` GitHub Action to apply the corrective pinning.
