# 2025-09-15: Windows Path Fixes - Clean Restart

## Context and Problem

After reviewing both the September 11th and September 15th work logs, it became clear that the September 15th investigation went down a complex rabbit hole with `wrangler` CJS/ESM issues and various patching approaches that didn't advance beyond the more focused work done on September 11th.

The September 11th investigation identified two core issues:
1. **Path Duplication (`C:\C:\`)**: Fixed by using `fileURLToPath(new URL(".", import.meta.url))` instead of `new URL(".", import.meta.url).pathname` in `sdk/src/lib/constants.mts`
2. **ESM URL Scheme (`ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`)**: Node.js ESM loader requires absolute Windows paths to be formatted as `file://` URLs

## Clean Slate Approach

Rather than building on top of the failed experiments from September 15th, we're taking a clean slate approach:
1. Reset the branch to match main exactly
2. Apply only the two targeted fixes identified in the September 11th investigation
3. Test to see if these focused changes resolve the Windows path issues

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a commit that reverts all changes to match main state
2. Apply the `fileURLToPath` fix to `constants.mts`
3. Apply the `pathToFileURL` fix to entry points in `runDirectivesScan.mts`
4. Test the Windows smoke tests to validate the fixes

This approach avoids the complexity and dead ends encountered in the September 15th work and focuses on the core path handling issues.
