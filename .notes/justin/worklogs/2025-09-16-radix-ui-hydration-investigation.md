# Work Log: 2025-09-16 - Radix UI Hydration Investigation

## 1. Initial State & Problem Definition

A hydration issue has been discovered that appears to be specific to Radix UI components when used with my RedwoodSDK framework. The issue manifests during the client-side hydration process, where React fails to properly reconcile the server-rendered HTML with the client-side component tree.

My core hypothesis is that this issue is related to portal-based components, as these components render content outside the normal DOM tree structure and may cause mismatches between server and client rendering expectations.

### Initial Investigation Goals:

1. Create a comprehensive test case with multiple Radix UI components
2. Reproduce the hydration issue consistently  
3. Identify whether portal-based components are the root cause
4. Develop a targeted solution for portal rendering in SSR

## 2. Initial Implementation: Non-Portal Components

The first phase involved implementing a comprehensive test case with multiple Radix UI components to establish a baseline and attempt to reproduce the hydration issue.

### Application Structure

The test was built on the minimal RedwoodSDK starter template with a comprehensive set of Radix UI component packages. A client component page (`RadixDemo.tsx`) was created with multiple interactive components, accessible via `/radix-demo` routing.

### Components Implemented

The test page included comprehensive examples across multiple categories:

1. **Form Controls:** Checkbox, Switch, Toggle, Labels with state management
2. **Progress & Sliders:** Progress bars with dynamic updates, Range sliders with real-time values
3. **Selection Components:** Radio groups, Select dropdowns with full keyboard navigation
4. **Layout Components:** Tabs with multiple content panels, Accordion with collapsible sections, visual Separators
5. **Interactive Components:** Collapsible content areas, Modal Dialog with focus management, Alert Dialog for confirmations, Toast notifications
6. **Additional Components:** Avatar with image fallback, Tooltip with hover interactions, Hover Card with rich content

All components included proper ARIA attributes and comprehensive state management to test hydration behavior.

## 3. Initial Test Results: No Hydration Issues Detected

After implementing and testing the comprehensive component suite, **no hydration issues were observed**. All components rendered correctly, maintained their state during hydration, and functioned as expected in both development and production builds.

This finding suggests that the hydration issue is not present in the majority of Radix UI components, but may be specific to a particular subset of components or usage patterns.

## 4. Hypothesis Refinement: Portal-Based Components

Given that the standard components showed no issues, my investigation focus has shifted to **portal-based components**. These components render content outside the normal DOM tree structure and are more likely to cause server/client rendering mismatches.

### Portal-Based Components in Radix UI

The following Radix UI components use portals and will be the focus of the next investigation phase:

- Dialog and AlertDialog (modal overlays)
- DropdownMenu (contextual menus)
- HoverCard (floating content)
- Popover (positioned content)
- Select (dropdown overlays)  
- Toast (notification overlays)
- Tooltip (hover overlays)

### Why Portals May Cause Issues

Portal-based components present unique challenges for SSR hydration:

1. **DOM Structure Mismatch:** Server renders portal content inline, client renders to portal root
2. **Timing Issues:** Portal mounting may occur after initial hydration
3. **Event Handler Attachment:** Event handlers may attach to different DOM locations
4. **Focus Management:** Focus restoration may fail if DOM structure differs

## 5. Portal Component Analysis and Implementation

Analysis of the Radix UI source code revealed the portal implementation pattern and identified the components that use portals.

### Portal Implementation Pattern

The Radix UI portal primitive (`@radix-ui/react-portal`) uses a specific SSR hydration pattern:

```typescript
const [mounted, setMounted] = React.useState(false);
useLayoutEffect(() => setMounted(true), []);
const container = containerProp || (mounted && globalThis?.document?.body);
return container ? ReactDOM.createPortal(<Primitive.div {...portalProps} ref={forwardedRef} />, container) : null;
```

This pattern ensures portals only render on the client after mounting, which is a common approach to handle server/client rendering differences but may cause hydration mismatches.

### Confirmed Portal-Based Components

Analysis of the Radix UI repository identified seven components that import and use the Portal primitive:

1. **Dialog** (`@radix-ui/react-dialog`) - Modal overlays with focus management
2. **Tooltip** (`@radix-ui/react-tooltip`) - Hover-triggered floating content
3. **Popover** (`@radix-ui/react-popover`) - Click-triggered floating content
4. **HoverCard** (`@radix-ui/react-hover-card`) - Rich hover content
5. **DropdownMenu** (`@radix-ui/react-menu`) - Contextual menus
6. **Select** (`@radix-ui/react-select`) - Dropdown selections
7. **Toast** (`@radix-ui/react-toast`) - Notification overlays

### Focused Test Implementation

A dedicated portal test page (`PortalDemo.tsx`) was created at `/portal-demo` with comprehensive examples of all confirmed portal-based components. Each component includes detailed styling and interaction patterns to test various hydration scenarios including:

- Portal mounting timing
- DOM structure reconciliation
- Event handler attachment
- Focus management
- Positioning and animation behavior

## 6. Next Steps: Hydration Testing

The portal-focused test implementation is now complete. The next phase involves systematic testing to reproduce the hydration issue.

### Testing Protocol

1. **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` to ensure all Radix UI portal components are available
2. **Development Testing:** Start the development server and test `/portal-demo` for any hydration warnings
3. **Production Testing:** Build and test the production version for hydration mismatches
4. **Browser Console Monitoring:** Document any hydration warnings or errors specific to portal components
5. **DOM Structure Analysis:** Compare server-rendered HTML with client-rendered DOM for portal content

### Expected Investigation Areas

The portal testing will focus on the specific hydration challenges identified in the portal implementation pattern:

1. **Conditional Rendering:** The `mounted` state pattern may cause server/client render differences
2. **Portal Container Resolution:** Different container resolution between server and client
3. **Event Handler Timing:** Event handlers attaching before or after portal mounting
4. **Focus Management:** Focus restoration in portal-based modals and overlays
5. **Animation and Positioning:** Popper-based positioning behavior during hydration

### Framework Context

- React 19.2.0 canary build with concurrent features and improved hydration
- RedwoodSDK with SSR and client hydration using React Server Components
- Vite build tool with custom plugin architecture for directive scanning
- Cloudflare Workers runtime environment with potential DOM API limitations

## 7. Hydration Error Reproduced with Portal Components

Testing the `/portal-demo` page successfully reproduced the hydration error. The browser console shows a mismatch for `aria-controls` and `id` attributes on multiple portal-based components.

### Hydration Mismatch Log

```
A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. [...]

<DialogTrigger>
  <button
    aria-expanded={false}
    aria-controls="radix-_R_8n_"
    data-state="closed"
    ...
  >
    Open Portal Dialog
  </button>
</DialogTrigger>

<PopoverTrigger>
  <button
    aria-expanded={false}
    aria-controls="radix-_R_9n_"
    data-state="closed"
    ...
  >
    Open Portal Popover
  </button>
</PopoverTrigger>

<SelectTrigger>
  <button
    role="combobox"
    aria-controls="radix-_R_a7_"
    aria-expanded={false}
    ...
  >
  </button>
</SelectTrigger>

<DropdownMenuTrigger>
  <button
    id="radix-_R_b7_"
    aria-haspopup="menu"
    aria-expanded={false}
    ...
  >
    Open Portal Menu
  </button>
</DropdownMenuTrigger>
```

The error clearly indicates that the IDs generated by Radix UI's internal `useId` hook are different between the server-rendered HTML and the client-side hydration pass. The server generates IDs like `radix-_R_25v6_`, while the client generates `radix-_R_8n_`.

## 8. Analysis and External Context

This `useId` mismatch is a known, complex issue in the React ecosystem, particularly within SSR and RSC frameworks. The root cause is that the server-side render of a client component and the client-side render can occur in slightly different contexts, leading to divergent ID generation sequences.

### Key Findings from Community Discussions:

1.  **Framework-Level Issue:** The problem is not unique to this framework. A similar issue was reported in Next.js ([vercel/next.js#78691](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/78691)), where `useId` produced different formats on the server (`:S1:`) versus the client (`«R2fl7»`). This points to frameworks potentially using different React instances or configurations for the server and client environments, which is consistent with my two-phase rendering architecture.

2.  **Historical Radix UI Problem:** Radix UI has contended with this since 2020 ([radix-ui/primitives#331](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/issues/331), [#811](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/issues/811)). Their original custom ID provider was non-deterministic, especially in `StrictMode`. The long-term solution was to adopt the official `React.useId` hook, which was designed to solve this exact problem. The re-emergence of this bug suggests an edge case created by the specifics of my RSC SSR implementation.

3.  **Community Workaround:** The most common workaround suggested in community channels is to provide explicit, stable `id` props to the Radix components ([Discord Thread 1](https://discord.com/channels/679514959968993311/1367567795893702708/1369746978665402534)). However, this is not always possible, as some components do not expose the necessary props to override the internally generated IDs.

4.  **The "Two-Phase Render" as a Cause:** My architecture document, `rsc-ssr-process.md`, details a process where client components are first prepared on the server (as part of an RSC payload) and _then_ rendered to HTML in a separate SSR pass. This two-step process on the server, followed by a third render on the client for hydration, creates multiple environments where `useId`'s internal counter could be initialized or incremented differently, leading to the mismatch.

### Historical Context and Community Findings

This `useId` hydration mismatch is a well-documented and recurring issue within the broader React ecosystem, particularly for frameworks that implement complex SSR or RSC rendering strategies. The provided history confirms this is not a new problem.

- **Discord Discussions (2025):** Community members in our framework's Discord have repeatedly encountered this issue, especially with UI libraries like Radix UI.

  - Key observations include the problem only appearing in `'use client'` components and being reproducible with a minimal `useId()` test case.
  - The primary workaround has been to manually provide stable `id` props to components, though this is not always possible as some Radix components don't expose the necessary props.
  - Reference: [Discord Thread 1](https://discord.com/channels/679514959968993311/1381937807408234496/1381971738883129527), [Discord Thread 2](https://discord.com/channels/679514959968993311/1367567795893702708/1369746978665402534)

- **Next.js Precedent ([vercel/next.js#78691](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/78691)):** The Next.js framework experienced a similar issue where `useId` generated different ID formats between the server and client. This reinforces the hypothesis that framework-level rendering architecture plays a significant role in how React's `useId` hook behaves.

- **Radix UI's History with SSR IDs:** Radix UI has a long history of tackling this problem.
  - Initial issues ([#331](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/issues/331), [#811](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/issues/811)) with their custom `IdProvider` in SSR and React's `StrictMode` led them to abandon it.
  - The definitive solution was to adopt the official `React.useId` hook, which was created by the React team to solve this exact problem ([#1006](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/pull/1006)).
  - The fact that the issue has reappeared for users of our framework (and previously for Next.js users) strongly suggests that my rendering pipeline is creating an edge case that interferes with React's built-in solution.

This historical context validates that the issue is not with Radix UI itself, but with the interaction between React's `useId` SSR mechanism and our framework's specific rendering architecture.

### Conclusion

The hydration error is a direct result of `React.useId` producing inconsistent values between the server-side HTML render and the client-side hydration. This is likely caused by our framework's two-phase SSR process for client components creating a different rendering context than the one on the client. The next step is to isolate and confirm this behavior.

## 9. `useId` Test Results and Analysis

The `useId` mismatch was consistently reproducible across multiple test runs. The server-rendered HTML contained IDs like `_R_76_`, while the client-side hydration generated `_R_0_`. This strongly suggests that the `useId` counter was not being correctly synchronized between the server and client.

### The `useId` Hook's Internal State

The `useId` hook in React maintains an internal counter (`_R_`) that is incremented with each call. This counter is typically initialized to 0 on the client.

```typescript
const [id] = React.useId();
```

### The `useId` Hook's SSR Process

When React processes a component for SSR, it serializes the current state of the `useId` counter. This state is then passed to the client-side hydration process.

```typescript
const [id] = React.useId();
```

### The `useId` Hook's Hydration Process

When React hydrates a component, it uses the `useId` counter that was serialized by the server.

```typescript
const [id] = React.useId();
```

### The `useId` Hook's Client-Side Initialization

When React initializes a new instance of the `useId` hook on the client, it starts the counter from 0.

```typescript
const [id] = React.useId();
```

### The `useId` Hook's Hydration Mismatch

The `useId` mismatch observed in my tests (`_R_76_` vs. `_R_0_`) indicates that the `useId` counter was not being correctly synchronized between the server and client. This is a critical issue for hydration, as `useId` is used to generate unique IDs for ARIA attributes, event handlers, and other framework-level elements.

## 10. Corrected Root Cause Analysis: `useId` Counter Desynchronization

The initial hypothesis that the `useId` mismatch was caused by different React runtimes (`react-server` vs. standard) was incorrect. As clarified, the use of different runtimes in the `worker` (RSC) and `ssr` (client component SSR) environments is intentional and correct by design. The `ssr` environment and the `client` environment both use the same classic React runtime, so the hydration mismatch must have a different cause.

### The New Hypothesis: Server Counter State is Not Transferred to Client

The root cause is a desynchronization of the `useId` internal counter between the server render and the client hydration.

1.  **Server Render Context:** During the server-side render (in the `ssr` environment), React processes the entire application tree as described by the RSC payload. This includes not just the user-facing components but also framework-level wrappers and providers. These internal components may also use `useId`, incrementing React's internal ID counter. By the time a specific client component like `UseIdDemo` is rendered, the counter has already reached a high value (e.g., 76).

2.  **Client Hydration Context:** When the client-side JavaScript loads, it begins the hydration process. It has no knowledge of the server's initial rendering of framework components. It initializes a fresh instance of React with a `useId` counter starting at 0.

3.  **The Mismatch:** When React tries to hydrate the `UseIdDemo` component, it generates an ID of `_R_0_`. This does not match the `_R_76_` in the server-rendered HTML, causing the hydration to fail.

The fundamental problem is that the state of the `useId` counter from the server is not being successfully passed down and used to "seed" the counter on the client, which is a process that React's SSR tooling should handle automatically. our framework's custom SSR bridge and rendering pipeline is likely interfering with this built-in synchronization mechanism.

### Next Step: Investigate React's `useId` SSR Synchronization Mechanism

The immediate next step is to investigate how `React.useId` is _supposed_ to work in a standard SSR environment. Understanding the mechanism React uses to serialize and resume the ID counter across the server-client boundary will allow me to identify where my custom rendering pipeline might be breaking this process. The investigation will focus on the data passed between `react-dom/server` and `react-dom/client` and how my `ssrBridge` might be failing to preserve it.

## 11. Definitive Root Cause: Broken `useId` State Transfer

An analysis of the React source code (`packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js`) has revealed the precise mechanism behind the `useId` hydration failure. The issue is not a bug in React, but a failure in our framework's custom rendering pipeline to correctly transfer the necessary state from the server to the client.

### React's `useId` Hydration Mechanism

The implementation of the `mountId` function, which is called by `useId` during the initial render, contains the following critical logic:

```javascript
// in React's source
function mountId(): string {
  // ...
  if (getIsHydrating()) {
    const treeId = getTreeId();
    id = '_' + identifierPrefix + 'R_' + treeId;
    // ...
  } else {
    // ... other ID generation logic for server or client-only render
  }
}
```

This reveals that React's `useId` hook relies on a server-generated "tree ID" to ensure consistency during client-side hydration. During the server render, React generates a sequence of these tree IDs. During hydration on the client, React expects to find this same sequence to regenerate the exact same IDs.

### How the Framework Breaks the Mechanism

The `useId` counter desynchronization is a symptom of this state transfer failing. our framework's two-phase render via the SSR Bridge is interrupting this data flow.

1.  **Server Render:** The `ssr` environment correctly generates the `treeId` sequence as it renders client components to HTML.
2.  **State Transfer Failure:** My custom pipeline, which bridges the `ssr` and `worker` environments and constructs the final HTML document, is not capturing this `treeId` state and embedding it in the page for the client to use.
3.  **Client Hydration:** The client-side React runtime does not find the expected `treeId` sequence. As a result, its `getTreeId()` function starts from a different (likely default) state, generating a completely different sequence of IDs (`_R_0_`, etc.) and causing the hydration to fail.

## 12. The Solution Path

The solution is to repair this broken state transfer. This will involve modifying our framework's rendering pipeline to correctly handle the state generated by React's SSR renderer.

### Next Steps

1.  **Identify the State Source:** Investigate the APIs of `react-dom/server` (e.g., `renderToPipeableStream`) to determine how the `treeId` sequence and any other necessary hydration state are exposed by the server renderer.
2.  **Audit the SSR Bridge:** Analyze the `ssrBridge` and the `transformRscToHtmlStream` function to identify where this state is being lost. The data needs to be captured from the output of the `ssr` environment's render.
3.  **Implement State Injection:** Modify the final HTML rendering logic to correctly serialize and embed this state into the HTML document, likely within a `<script>` tag, so that the client-side `react-dom/client` can consume it during hydration.

## 13. Definitive Mechanism: The `resumableState` Object

The successful hydration of `React.useId` is entirely dependent on a server-generated object called `resumableState`. A deep dive into the React DOM server source code (`packages/react-dom/src/server/ReactDOMFizzServerNode.js`) has revealed this is the exact mechanism React uses to synchronize `useId` across the server and client.

### How it Works

1.  **Creation on the Server:** When `renderToPipeableStream` (or a similar Fizz server API) is called, it internally creates a `resumableState` object. This object is initialized with an `identifierPrefix` and serves as the container for all state needed to "resume" or "hydrate" the application on the client, including the initial state of the `useId` counter.

2.  **Serialization and Injection:** The React server renderer then serializes this `resumableState` and typically embeds it within the HTML stream, often as part of the bootstrap script content.

3.  **Consumption by the Client:** The client-side React runtime finds this serialized state during its initialization and uses it to configure its own internal state, including seeding the `useId` counter to the exact state it was in at the end of the server render.

### How the Framework Breaks It

The current implementation of my runtime rendering functions is the point of failure. The `ssrBridge` correctly provides the `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream` function from the `ssr` environment to the `worker` environment. However, the data contract between these functions is incomplete.

1.  **SSR Render:** Inside the `ssr` environment, the `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream` function calls React's `renderToPipeableStream`. This call correctly generates both the HTML stream and the critical `resumableState` object.

2.  **State Transfer Failure:** The `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream` function currently only returns the HTML stream. It effectively discards the `resumableState` object, which is never passed back across the bridge to the calling `worker` environment.

3.  **Final HTML Assembly:** The `transformRscToHtmlStream` function in the `worker` environment receives only the HTML stream. It assembles the final response without the necessary `resumableState`, meaning the client never receives the data needed to synchronize its `useId` counter.

## 14. The Solution: Passing `resumableState` Through the Rendering Functions

The solution is to modify the signatures of my runtime rendering functions to correctly handle and forward the `resumableState`. This is a change to the runtime code, not the Vite plugin build configuration.

### Implementation Plan

1.  **Modify `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream` (in the `ssr` environment):** This function's signature must be changed. Instead of just returning a `ReadableStream`, it must return an object or tuple containing both the stream and the `resumableState` object generated by the React server renderer.

2.  **Update `transformRscToHtmlStream` (in the `worker` environment):** This function, which calls the bridge function, must be updated to handle the new return signature. It will receive both the stream and the `resumableState` and must pass them up the call stack.

3.  **Inject State in `renderToStream` (in the `worker` environment):** This higher-level function will ultimately receive the `resumableState`. It will then be responsible for serializing this state and injecting it into the final HTML response stream that is sent to the browser.

This change will repair the broken state transfer by ensuring the `resumableState` is passed from the `ssr` environment where it is created, back to the `worker` environment where the final response is assembled, and finally down to the client.

## 15. Rationale for the `bootstrapScriptContent` Approach

After a deep investigation into React's source code, the precise mechanism and rationale for the `bootstrapScriptContent` fix has been clarified. The solution is not a workaround, but the correct usage of React's server rendering API to signal the intent to hydrate.

The key insight is that the `bootstrapScriptContent` option provides a **template** for the very `<script>` tag that React generates to embed the `resumableState` JSON into the HTML stream. The option's purpose is to tell React what other JavaScript code, if any, should be placed inside that same script tag along with the hydration state.

- When `bootstrapScriptContent: ' '` is provided, I am giving React the minimal valid template. I am instructing it to generate the state-bearing script tag, but telling it that I have no _additional_ code to place inside that specific tag.

This correctly triggers the serialization of `resumableState`—which is required to fix the `useId` hydration mismatch—without producing any redundant or unwanted client-side code. It is the most direct and precise way to enable hydration.

## 16. Attempted Solution: Stream Coalescing

Further testing revealed a critical race condition in the `StreamStitcher` implementation. The issue was that the `documentStream` (which is simple and renders quickly) would often be fully processed before the `reactShellStream` (containing the full app) had been processed by the `BodyContentExtractor`. This meant the placeholder replacement would fail because the content wasn't ready yet.

The insight was that the `StreamStitcher`, as a `TransformStream`, was the wrong tool for the job as it can only operate on a single primary stream. A more robust solution was needed to correctly coordinate two independent streams.

### 16.1. The Coalescing Strategy

The `StreamStitcher` was removed entirely and the `assembleHtmlStreams` function was rewritten to implement a "stream coalescing" strategy. Instead of a transform stream, the function now constructs and returns a new `ReadableStream` that manually orchestrates the merging of the two input streams.

This new implementation works by:

1.  Reading from the `documentStream` and buffering its content.
2.  Upon finding the `</head>` tag, it pauses, `awaits` the `preamblePromise` from the `PreambleExtractor`, injects the preamble content, and then continues.
3.  Upon finding the body placeholder, it pauses again and pipes the entire `appContentStream` from the `BodyContentExtractor` into the output.
4.  Finally, it streams the remainder of the `documentStream`.

This approach completely eliminates the race condition by ensuring that the process explicitly waits for the necessary data from the slower `reactShellStream` before continuing to process the faster `documentStream`. The updated unit tests for `assembleHtmlStreams` now all pass, confirming the correctness of this solution.

## 17. Worker Integration Issue

During debugging with extensive logging, I discovered that the worker was bypassing the new `renderToStream` function entirely. The worker was calling `renderToRscStream` and `transformRscToHtmlStream` directly, which meant the two-stream coalescing logic was never executed. This explained why no logs from `renderToStream` or `assembleHtmlStreams` were appearing.

I updated the worker to use `renderToStream` for HTML requests while preserving the old approach for RSC-only requests. This ensures that the hydration fix is actually applied to user requests.

## 18. Placeholder Rendering Issue

Testing revealed that the placeholder `<div id="__RWS_APP_HTML__"></div>` was being rendered as escaped text rather than actual HTML. This was because React was treating the placeholder string as text content and escaping it for safety. I fixed this by using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in `renderDocumentToStream` to inject the placeholder as raw HTML. I also updated the placeholder name from `__RWS_APP_HTML__` to `__RWSDK_APP_HTML__` for consistency with the framework naming.

## 19. RSC Payload Stream Connection Issue

After fixing the placeholder rendering, the stream coalescing appeared to work, but a new issue emerged on the client-side. The application would initially render and then immediately disappear, accompanied by a "Connection closed" error in the browser console. The error's stack trace pointed to the client-side code responsible for consuming the RSC payload stream, suggesting that the stream was being terminated prematurely.

My hypothesis was that the RSC payload stream was being consumed or closed during the server-side stream coalescing, leaving nothing for the client to read.

## 20. Attempted Fix: Adjusting RSC Payload Injection Timing

To address the "Connection closed" error, I refactored the `renderToStream` function. The RSC stream was teed, with one branch used for generating the HTML shell and the other reserved for payload injection. My plan was to perform the stream coalescing first and then pipe the final, complete HTML stream through the `injectRSCPayload` utility. This was intended to preserve the RSC stream for client consumption while still embedding the payload in the HTML output.

However, upon testing, this did not resolve the underlying hydration mismatch.

## 21. Verifying Stream Coalescing with Logging

With the hydration issue still present, it became necessary to verify the stream coalescing logic itself. My plan was to add aggressive logging to trace the contents of each stream involved in the `assembleHtmlStreams` function to confirm whether the preamble and app body were being extracted and injected correctly.

An initial attempt at this using an async helper function (`logStreamContent`) that drained the stream to log its content introduced a new bug: a `ReadableStream is currently locked to a reader` error. This was caused by a race condition where the logging function consumed a teed-off branch of the stream too aggressively, conflicting with the main processing logic. The logging approach was subsequently revised to use a non-destructive `TransformStream` that inspects chunks as they pass through without altering the stream's state.

## 22. Root Cause Discovered: Missing `bootstrapModules` Option

After multiple attempts to resolve the hydration issue, analysis of the server logs revealed the definitive root cause. The HTML shell generated by React's `renderToReadableStream` consistently had an empty `<head>` tag, meaning the critical `resumableState` object (which contains the `useId` seed) was never being generated.

The problem was a missing configuration option in the `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream` function. According to React's API, the `bootstrapModules` option must be provided to `renderToReadableStream` to signal that the output is a hydratable document. Without this, React does not include the necessary hydration preamble.

The final fix was to add `bootstrapModules: ["/src/client.tsx"]` to the options object passed to `renderToReadableStream`. This correctly instructs React to generate the `resumableState` script. This script is then captured by the `PreambleExtractor` and injected into the final document by the `assembleHtmlStreams` function, resolving the `useId` hydration mismatch. The previous "Connection closed" and "stream locked" errors were determined to be side effects of incorrect debugging attempts, not the underlying issue.

## 23. Course Correction: Reverting Flawed Architecture

Upon review, it became clear that the entire stream-coalescing architecture (documented in sections 16-22) was a complex solution to a problem that was misunderstood. The evidence from the React source code shows that the `resumableState` is not a byproduct of rendering a full HTML shell, but a direct result of providing the correct bootstrap options to `renderToReadableStream`.

My previous approach was a rabbit hole. The complex logic of `assembleHtmlStreams` and the `streamExtractors` is unnecessary. The correct approach is a much simpler, more traditional SSR setup where React renders the application stream, and that stream is passed as children to the user's `Document`.

To correct this, all source code and architecture documentation changes related to the stream-coalescing implementation are being reverted to the state on the `main` branch. This provides a clean foundation to apply the correct, simpler fix. The history of this incorrect path is preserved in this log as a record of the investigation.

## 24. Research: The `bootstrapModules` vs. `bootstrapScriptContent` APIs

A deep analysis of the React DOM server source code (`packages/react-dom-bindings/src/server/ReactFizzConfigDOM.js`) provided the definitive answers.

### The `createResumableState` Function

The investigation began with the `createResumableState` function, which is the entry point for configuring hydration.

```javascript
// in packages/react-dom-bindings/src/server/ReactFizzConfigDOM.js
export function createResumableState(
  //...
  bootstrapScriptContent: string | void,
  bootstrapScripts: $ReadOnlyArray<string | BootstrapScriptDescriptor> | void,
  bootstrapModules: $ReadOnlyArray<string | BootstrapScriptDescriptor> | void,
): ResumableState {
  return {
    //...
    bootstrapScriptContent,
    bootstrapScripts,
    bootstrapModules,
    //...
  };
}
```

**Finding:** This function is a simple data container. It takes all the bootstrap options and stores them on the `resumableState` object. The behavioral difference must occur where this object is consumed.

### The Bootstrap Writing Process

Further analysis of the renderer's internal functions (conceptually, `writeBootstrap`) reveals how these properties are used:

- `bootstrapScriptContent`: This option is designed to inject raw JavaScript content _inside_ a `<script>` tag. My previous attempt with `bootstrapScriptContent: ' '` created an empty script (`<script> </script>`) which was insufficient to signal React's full hydration intent. It likely expects executable code.

- `bootstrapModules`: This option is specifically for ES Modules. When the React renderer sees this option is present, it understands that the HTML is intended to be hydrated by a module script. This triggers two critical, non-negotiable actions:
    1.  **It guarantees the serialization of the `resumableState` object**, which contains the `useId` seed, and injects it into the stream. This is the primary goal.
    2.  It automatically renders the necessary `<link rel="modulepreload">` tags and the final `<script type="module" src="...">` tag for the provided entry point.

### The Definitive Conclusion and Conflict

The evidence is clear: **`bootstrapModules` is the explicit and correct API to signal a hydratable, module-based application.** It is the key to forcing React to generate the `resumableState`.

However, this creates a direct conflict with our framework's existing architecture as described in `documentTransforms.md`. our framework is designed to have the user place `<script src="/src/client.tsx">` in their `Document`, which a Vite plugin then transforms to add hashing and a CSP nonce.

If I use `bootstrapModules`, React will also render a script tag for the client entry point, leading to duplicate scripts and bypassing my transformation logic.

### The Surgically Correct Path Forward

To align with React's intended API while making the most minimal change, I must cede control of the _entry point script tag_ to React.

1.  **The `Document` must be simplified:** The user's `Document.tsx` should no longer contain the manual `<script src="/src/client.tsx">` tag. React will now handle its rendering.
2.  **our framework's role:** My `documentTransforms.md` logic is still necessary for injecting CSP nonces into other scripts and for handling stylesheets, but its role in managing the primary client entry point script is superseded by React's bootstrap mechanism.

This is a small but significant shift in architectural responsibility, and it is the simplest and most direct path to resolving the hydration issue.

## 25. Implementation of the New Architecture

Based on the research, the following implementation will be carried out:

1.  Remove all remnants of the flawed stream-coalescing architecture (`assembleHtmlStreams`, `streamExtractors`, etc.).
2.  Modify `renderToStream.tsx` to adopt a simpler, traditional SSR flow. It will call `transformRscToHtmlStream`, which will now return a stream containing the `resumableState` and the app HTML. This stream will then be passed as `children` to the user's `Document`.
3.  Modify `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream` to no longer render a full `<html>` document. It will render only the application itself inside the root `<div>` and will use the `bootstrapModules` option to trigger hydration state generation.
4.  Remove the `<script src="/src/client.tsx">` from the example application's `Document.tsx` to prevent script duplication.

## 26. Course Correction: Prioritizing Backwards Compatibility

A foundational principle of our framework is providing the user with transparent control over their application's final HTML structure via `Document.tsx`. My previous implementation plan (Section 25), which required removing the manual `<script>` tag from the user's `Document`, violated this principle and is therefore invalid. The `Document.tsx` file and its contents are to be treated as an inviolable part of the user-facing API.

The core technical challenge remains: I must trigger React to serialize its `resumableState` (to fix `useId`) without interfering with the user's `Document.tsx`.

The `bootstrapModules` API is not a viable solution, as it forces React to render its own script tag, creating duplication and bypassing our framework's script transformation logic. This is an unacceptable side effect.

### A New Surgical Experiment

To move forward, I will conduct a minimal, surgical experiment to validate an alternative hypothesis. The React source code analysis suggests that the `bootstrapScriptContent` option might also trigger `resumableState` serialization. While a previous attempt noted in this log was deemed "insufficient," a closer reading suggests the minimal-but-valid value of `' '` (a single space) might provide the correct signal to React without producing any unwanted side effects.

The experiment is as follows:

1.  Make a single-line change to `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream.tsx`.
2.  Add the option `bootstrapScriptContent: ' '` to the `renderToReadableStream` call.
3.  No other files, especially the starters or `Document.tsx`, will be modified.

This test will definitively confirm if `bootstrapScriptContent` is a viable, backwards-compatible path to resolving the hydration issue.

## 27. Clarification: Re-validating the `bootstrapScriptContent` Experiment

It is correct to note that the surgical experiment with `bootstrapScriptContent: ' '` (proposed in Section 26) appears identical to the rationale from Section 15. The critical difference is the context in which the experiment is being run.

My initial attempt was not performed in isolation. It was immediately followed by the implementation of a complex and ultimately flawed stream-coalescing architecture (Sections 16-21). This architecture introduced numerous confounding variables and severe bugs, including stream race conditions and incorrect worker integration.

The subsequent failures and debugging efforts were focused on that broken architecture. The conclusion reached in Section 22—that `bootstrapModules` was the only solution—was based on data gathered from within that flawed system.

Having reverted all changes related to stream-coalescing (as decided in Section 23), I am now operating on a clean, simple, and correct SSR foundation. Therefore, this is the first time I am able to test the `bootstrapScriptContent` hypothesis in a controlled environment, free from the noise and errors of the previous implementation. This is not a repetition, but a proper validation of the original, simpler idea.

## 28. Course Correction: False Positive and New Hypothesis

Initial testing of the `bootstrapScriptContent: ' '` solution appeared successful, but this has been identified as a false positive. The success was coincidental, caused by a separate issue where the client-side entry point script (`<script>import("/src/client.tsx")</script>`) had been accidentally removed from the test application's `Document.tsx`. Without the client entry point, no hydration was occurring, and therefore no hydration mismatch errors were thrown.

With the client entry point correctly restored, the `useId` hydration mismatch error persists.

### New Evidence and Hypothesis: Script Ordering

Analysis of the HTML output reveals a critical detail. When `bootstrapScriptContent: ' '` is used, React **does** inject the marker script (`<script id="_R_">`). However, it injects it at the end of the `<body>`, _after_ the manually placed client entry point script.

This leads to a new, more precise hypothesis: **The hydration marker script must appear in the document _before_ the client script is executed.** The client-side React runtime needs to see the marker _before_ it begins its initial render, so it can boot in the correct "hydration mode." In the current state, the client script runs first, React boots in its default mode, and the `useId` mismatch occurs before the late-arriving marker script is ever parsed.

The challenge is now to reorder these two scripts.

## 29. Investigation of Reordering Solutions

Based on the new hypothesis, three potential solutions were investigated:

1.  **The React-Idiomatic Solution (Recommended):** This approach involves ceding control of the client entry point script to React. I would remove the manual `<script>` tag from `Document.tsx` and instead use the `bootstrapModules: ["/src/client.tsx"]` option in `renderToReadableStream`. React's internal logic guarantees that it will render the hydration state/marker _before_ it renders the entry point script, ensuring the correct order. This is the cleanest and most robust solution, though it requires updating the `documentTransforms.md` architecture to reflect that the entry point script is now framework-managed.

2.  **The Build-Time AST Solution:** This would involve modifying my `transformJsxScriptTagsPlugin.mts` to find the entry script tag in the `Document.tsx` AST, remove it, and attempt to reinject it in the correct place at runtime. This is programmatically complex, brittle, and introduces significant "magic" that would be hard to maintain.

3.  **The Runtime Stream Solution:** This would require a `TransformStream` to buffer the HTML and manually reorder the script tags on the fly. This approach is highly stateful, prone to race conditions, and mirrors the previously failed stream-coalescing architecture. It is the highest-risk option.

### Conclusion

The first option is the most direct path to a reliable fix. The next step is to implement it, which will involve changing `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream.tsx` to use `bootstrapModules` and removing the manual script tag from the starter applications.

## 31. A New Plan: Build-Time Transformation for Runtime Control

The "React-Idiomatic" solution of using `bootstrapModules` is the correct path, but my previous conclusion that it requires changing the user-facing `Document.tsx` API is incorrect. A more sophisticated approach can preserve my existing architecture and developer experience.

The new plan is to enhance my build-time tooling to give the runtime the information it needs to correctly use React's bootstrap APIs. The user will continue to place a standard `<script>` tag in their `Document.tsx`; my tools will intercept it and handle the rest.

### The Implementation Plan

The plan consists of two main parts: a build-time transformation and a runtime rendering adjustment.

#### **Part 1: Enhance `transformJsxScriptTagsPlugin.mts`**

The core of this plan is to modify my existing Vite plugin that processes `Document.tsx` files. It will now be responsible for identifying the main client entry point script, removing it from the document's AST, and replacing it with a side-effect that passes the script's information to the runtime via the `requestInfo` object.

The plugin must handle two distinct cases:

**1. For inline entry scripts (e.g., `<script>import("/src/client.tsx")</script>`):**

- **Detection:** The plugin will identify a script tag whose `children` contain a dynamic `import()` of a root-relative path.
- **Transformation:** The original `jsx("script", ...)` call will be removed from the AST and replaced with a side-effect that populates two new sets on the `requestInfo` object:
  - `requestInfo.rw.inlineScripts.add("<script content>")`: Stores the full content of the inline script.
  - `requestInfo.rw.scriptsToBeLoaded.add("/src/client.tsx")`: The existing mechanism for tracking dependencies is maintained.

**2. For external entry scripts (e.g., `<script src="/src/client.tsx">`):**

- **Detection:** The plugin will identify a script tag with a root-relative `src` attribute.
- **Transformation:** The original `jsx("script", ...)` call will be removed and replaced with a side-effect that populates:
  - `requestInfo.rw.entryScripts.add("/src/client.tsx")`: Stores the path of the external script.
  - `requestInfo.rw.scriptsToBeLoaded.add("/src/client.tsx")`: Again, the existing dependency tracking is maintained.

This transformation cleanly separates the user's _intent_ (including a client script) from the final _implementation_ (how that script is rendered).

#### **Part 2: Enhance Runtime Rendering in `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream.tsx`**

The SSR rendering function will be updated to use the information gathered by the build-time plugin. It will inspect the new `requestInfo` sets and dynamically construct the options for React's `renderToReadableStream`.

- If `requestInfo.rw.entryScripts` is populated, it will pass the script paths to the `bootstrapModules` option.
- If `requestInfo.rw.inlineScripts` is populated, it will pass the script content to the `bootstrapScriptContent` option.

This ensures I use the correct React API for the job, guaranteeing that React's hydration marker script is injected _before_ the client entry point is loaded.

#### **Ensuring Production Builds Work Correctly**

A critical consideration is ensuring that the paths passed to `bootstrapModules` are the final, hashed asset paths in a production build, not the source paths. The current build process uses a "placeholder" system (`rwsdk_asset:...`) which is resolved in a final "linker" pass.

This new approach is compatible with that system. At runtime, the `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream` function will need access to the client `manifest.json` to map the source path (e.g., `/src/client.tsx`) from `entryScripts` to its final hashed asset path (e.g., `/assets/client.a1b2c3d4.js`). I must ensure that my build process makes the manifest available to the SSR runtime environment so this mapping can occur.

This plan achieves the desired outcome: it fixes the hydration bug using React's idiomatic APIs while preserving my core architectural principle of a user-controlled `Document.tsx`. The `documentTransforms.md` and `unifiedScriptDiscovery.md` documents will be updated upon successful implementation.

## 34. Re-evaluation and the Critical Suspense Context

The "Virtual Manifest Module" approach, while technically sound for resolving the race condition, was ultimately abandoned due to critical context regarding our framework's hydration strategy with React Suspense.

### The Flaw in the Virtual Module Approach

The virtual module solution relied on the framework taking control of the entry script and passing it to React's `bootstrapModules` option at runtime. This would have re-introduced a previously solved, critical performance issue.

### The Early Hydration Problem

As documented in historical pull requests ([#369](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/pull/369), [#316](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/pull/316)), the framework intentionally uses an inline `<script>import("/src/client.tsx")</script>` tag instead of a standard `<script type="module">`.

- **`<script type="module">` is deferred:** The browser will not execute a module script until the entire HTML document has been downloaded. In a streaming response, this means waiting for all `<Suspense>` boundaries to resolve. This delays interactivity for the parts of the UI that are visible immediately.
- **Inline `import()` executes immediately:** An inline script is executed as soon as it's parsed. Using `import()` allows hydration to begin the moment the initial shell is rendered, making visible components interactive long before the full stream has completed.

This immediate hydration is a core architectural feature for providing a good user experience with streaming. Any solution that reverts to a deferred script-loading behavior is a regression. The virtual module approach would have caused this regression.

## 35. A New Experimental Path: Understanding React's Behavior

Given these constraints, I am back to the core challenge: I must trigger React's `resumableState` generation (to fix `useId`) while preserving the user-controlled, immediately-executing inline script.

Before proceeding, I need to definitively understand how React's `bootstrapModules` option behaves. I will conduct two experiments to gather this information.

### Experiment 1: `useId` and Script Placement Validation

**Goal:**

1.  Confirm that using `bootstrapModules` does, in fact, resolve the `useId` hydration mismatch.
2.  Observe exactly where and how React injects the `<script>` tag and the hydration marker into the final HTML document.

**Method:**

1.  Temporarily remove the manual `<script>import("/src/client.tsx")</script>` from the test application's `Document.tsx`.
2.  Hardcode the `bootstrapModules: ["/src/client.tsx"]` option in the framework's `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream.tsx` function.

### Experiment 2: Suspense and Interactivity Validation

**Goal:**

1.  Determine if using `bootstrapModules` preserves the immediate interactivity of non-suspended client components during a streaming render.

**Method:**

1.  Create a new test page in the application.
2.  This page will feature a simple `<Counter />` client component that renders immediately, followed by a `<SuspendedComponent />` that simulates a slow data fetch.
3.  I will observe if the counter becomes interactive as soon as it is visible, or if its hydration is delayed until the suspended component has finished loading.

The findings from these two experiments will provide the necessary data to make an informed decision on the correct architectural path forward.

## 36. Experiment 1 Results: `bootstrapModules` Fails to Resolve Hydration Mismatch

The first experiment was conducted by removing the manual entry script from the test app's `Document.tsx` and hardcoding the `bootstrapModules: ["/src/client.tsx"]` option in the framework's SSR renderer. The results were definitive and surprising.

### Key Observation 1: React's Script Injection Behavior

When using `bootstrapModules`, React's server renderer injects two key elements into the HTML:

1.  A `<link rel="modulepreload" ...>` tag in the `<head>`.
2.  A `<script type="module" src="/src/client.tsx" async="">` at the end of the `<body>`.

Critically, this script tag is given an `id="_R_"`, which identifies it as the carrier for React's hydration `resumableState`. The `async` attribute is also notable, as it confirms that this method does not guarantee immediate, blocking execution in the way an inline script does.

### Key Observation 2: The Hydration Mismatch Persists

Despite React correctly injecting its state-carrying script tag, the `useId` mismatch error remains.

- **Server-rendered ID:** `_R_1q_`
- **Client-rendered ID:** `_R_0_`

This is a critical finding. It proves that the root cause of my hydration issue is not simply the absence of the `_R_` script tag. Even when the tag is present and rendered by React itself, the client-side runtime is still failing to consume the state and initialize its `useId` counter correctly.

This invalidates the hypothesis that merely switching to `bootstrapModules` would solve the problem. The issue is more fundamental, likely related to how the `resumableState` is being generated on the server or consumed on the client within my specific framework setup. Given this failure, proceeding to Experiment 2 (Suspense interactivity) is unnecessary, as this architectural path has already been proven unviable for fixing the primary bug.

## 37. Historical Context: The Necessity of Inline `import()` for Early Hydration

Further review, prompted by historical context from previous pull requests, has clarified the critical importance of our framework's existing script-loading strategy. The use of an inline `<script>import("...")</script>` is not arbitrary; it is a deliberate architectural decision to solve a specific performance problem related to streaming and React Suspense.

### The Deferred Execution Problem of Module Scripts

As documented in PRs [#369](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/pull/369) and [#316](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/pull/316), using a standard `<script type="module" src="...">` for the client entry point causes a significant user-facing issue:

1.  **Module Scripts are Deferred:** By browser specification, module scripts only execute after the entire HTML document has been downloaded and parsed.
2.  **Conflict with Streaming:** In a streaming SSR context with `<Suspense>`, this means the browser waits for all slow data fetches to complete and all suspended content to be delivered before executing the client script.
3.  **Delayed Interactivity:** The result is that client components in the initial shell (e.g., a counter, a menu button) are visible to the user but remain non-interactive until the slowest part of the page has finished loading. This negates a primary benefit of streaming.

### The Inline `import()` Solution

our framework's solution was to switch to an inline script that executes immediately upon being parsed:

```html
<script>
  import("/src/client.tsx");
</script>
```

This ensures that hydration begins the moment the initial shell is available, making the UI interactive for the user as quickly as possible, even while other parts of the page are still streaming in. This behavior was validated in a detailed [Loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/bff7da89f3b449b38a1c411f3b6cb563).

### Implications for the Current Problem

This context is critical. My first experiment showed that React's `bootstrapModules` API renders an `<script type="module" async ...>`. The `async` attribute strongly suggests that it will not provide the immediate, blocking execution required to solve the early interactivity problem.

Therefore, the second experiment (Suspense and Interactivity Validation) remains critically important. I must empirically verify if React's solution can match the interactivity performance of my existing inline `import()` strategy.

## 44. Breakthrough: The Hydration Fix is `DOMContentLoaded`

A significant breakthrough has been made. The `useId` hydration mismatch is resolved by wrapping the core logic of the `initClient` function inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener.

### The `_R_` Script was a Red Herring

Crucially, this fix works **without** relying on React's `bootstrapModules` option. By reverting to our framework's original approach of a user-defined `<script>import("...")</script>` in `Document.tsx`, and applying the `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper, the hydration mismatch is still resolved.

This is a critical finding. It proves that the root cause of the `useId` mismatch was never about the presence or absence of the `<script id="_R_">` tag. That was a red herring. The true problem was a race condition:

1.  Modern script loading (`<script type="module" async>` or an inline `import()`) causes the client-side JavaScript to execute as soon as it's downloaded.
2.  This was happening _before_ the browser had finished parsing the entire initial HTML document.
3.  `initClient` was therefore calling `hydrateRoot` on an incomplete DOM, before React's internal state initialization (which relies on a complete document) had a chance to run.

Waiting for `DOMContentLoaded` guarantees that the entire DOM is parsed and ready before hydration is attempted, which resolves the issue.

### The New Challenge: A Potential Regression in Streaming Interactivity

This solution introduces a new, critical question. The `DOMContentLoaded` event only fires after the entire HTML document has been parsed. In a streaming SSR scenario with `<Suspense>`, if a component is suspended waiting for data, the server will pause the stream. This will delay the closing `</body>` and `</html>` tags, which will in turn delay the `DOMContentLoaded` event.

This could re-introduce a major bug that was previously fixed: client components in the initial shell may not become interactive until all suspense boundaries have been resolved and the full document is loaded.

The immediate next step is to repair the `SuspenseTestPage` in the test application to verify if this interactivity regression occurs.

## 45. Test Results: `DOMContentLoaded` Blocks Early Interactivity

The follow-up test on the `SuspenseTestPage` has confirmed my fears. Wrapping the `initClient` call in a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener successfully fixes the `useId` hydration mismatch, but it comes at the cost of a critical regression: **early interactivity is now broken.**

### Key Observation

With the `DOMContentLoaded` listener in place, the `<Counter />` component in the test page is no longer interactive while the `<SuspendedComponent />` is loading. The counter only becomes responsive after the 2-second delay has passed and the final suspended content has been streamed from the server.

This confirms that `DOMContentLoaded` is too blunt an instrument. It waits for the _entire_ document to be parsed, which in a streaming context, means waiting for the slowest data fetch to complete. This negates the primary user experience benefit of streaming with Suspense.

### The Core Problem: Finding the "Just Right" Moment for Hydration

I am now at the heart of the problem. I need to find a way to initialize my client-side React application at a very specific moment:

- **Not too early:** It must be _after_ whatever internal state React sets up on the client to consume the server-rendered `useId` seed. Initializing before this leads to the hydration mismatch.
- **Not too late:** It must be _before_ the full document stream has finished. Waiting until the end (i.e., `DOMContentLoaded`) delays interactivity.

The next step is a deep investigation into the React DOM client source code to find the precise, observable event or state change that signals React's internal state is ready. I need to find the trigger that React itself uses.

## 46. New Hypothesis: The `__FLIGHT_DATA__` Race Condition

My investigation has revealed a flaw in previous assumptions. The core issue is likely not about waiting for DOM nodes to exist, but about waiting for the streamed RSC payload to be available on the client.

### Revisiting the Facts

1.  The user's `Document.tsx` places the client entry point script (`<script>import...</script>`) _after_ the `<div id="hydrate-root">`. Due to synchronous HTML parsing, this guarantees the `hydrate-root` element is in the DOM when my script executes.
2.  Despite this, immediate execution of `initClient` causes a `useId` mismatch.
3.  Delaying execution until `DOMContentLoaded` fixes the `useId` mismatch but breaks streaming interactivity by waiting for the entire stream to finish.

### The Contradiction and the New Theory

The contradiction is that the necessary DOM is present, but hydration still fails. This leads to a new hypothesis: the client-side `initClient` function is executing before all of the inline `<script>` tags containing the RSC payload (`globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__`) have been streamed down from the server and parsed by the browser.

When I wait for `DOMContentLoaded`, I am implicitly waiting for the entire stream to complete, which ensures `__FLIGHT_DATA__` is fully populated. This is why the mismatch is fixed, and also why streaming interactivity breaks.

The "just right" moment for hydration is therefore not just when the `hydrate-root` div is available, but when the initial RSC payload required for the first paint is available in the `__FLIGHT_DATA__` global.

### Next Step: Test the Hypothesis

To test this, I will re-instrument the `initClient` function to specifically inspect the state of `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__`. I will log its contents immediately upon execution and then again after a short `setTimeout` delay to observe if it's being populated asynchronously as the stream arrives.

## 47. Final Breakthrough: The Flawed `__FLIGHT_DATA__` Check

The final round of instrumentation provided the answer, though not in the way I expected. The logs confirmed that `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__` is indeed `undefined` when `initClient` first executes. However, the key insight came from re-examining how the RSC payload is consumed.

### The Real Mechanism: `rsc-html-stream`

The framework does not rely on a one-time check of the `__FLIGHT_DATA__` global. Instead, it uses the `rsc-html-stream/client` package.

1.  The server sends multiple inline `<script>` tags, each pushing a chunk of the RSC payload into the `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__` array.
2.  The imported `rscStream` object on the client is a ReadableStream designed to watch this global array.
3.  As the browser parses the document and executes the inline scripts, `rscStream` observes the new data and emits it, feeding it to React via `createFromReadableStream`.

### The Root Cause: A Faulty Guard Clause

The bug was a simple but critical guard clause in my `initClient` function:

```typescript
if ((globalThis as any).__FLIGHT_DATA) {
  rscPayload = createFromReadableStream(rscStream, { ... });
}
```

Because `initClient` runs before the inline payload scripts, this condition was always false. I was **never calling `createFromReadableStream`**, effectively starving the client of the entire RSC payload. This meant React was attempting to hydrate with no data, causing the `useId` mismatch and a total failure of hydration.

### The Solution: Trust the Stream

The solution is to remove the faulty `if` check. I must unconditionally call `createFromReadableStream` and trust the `rsc-html-stream` library to wait for and process the data as it arrives. This aligns with the library's design and correctly connects React to the streamed payload. This should fix the `useId` mismatch without needing to delay hydration until `DOMContentLoaded`, thus preserving early interactivity for streaming Suspense.

## 48. Clarification: The `useEffect` Workaround and the Root Cause of Hydration Mismatch

Upon closer inspection and user inquiry, it became clear that the presence of a `useEffect` hook in the `Content` component was masking the true nature of the hydration problem. While the `if ((globalThis as any).__FLIGHT_DATA)` check was indeed always falsy initially, the application _appeared_ to function due to this `useEffect` acting as an unintentional two-phase rendering workaround.

### The `useEffect` Mechanism:

1.  **Initial Render (Empty):** When `initClient` first executed, `rscPayload` was `undefined` because the `if` check prevented `createFromReadableStream` from being called. `hydrateRoot` proceeded with an "empty" `rscPayload`.
2.  **`useEffect` Triggers:** Immediately after this initial (and effectively empty) render, the `useEffect` hook would fire. It would observe that `streamData` (derived from `rscPayload`) was falsy.
3.  **Stream Creation and Re-render:** Inside the `useEffect`, `setStreamData` was called, which _then_ finally executed `createFromReadableStream(rscStream, {...})`. By this point, the browser's HTML parser had processed the inline RSC payload scripts, and `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__` was populated. This `setStreamData` call triggered a re-render.
4.  **Second Render (Content Populated):** During this second render, `streamData` contained the actual RSC content, and the application components would appear.

### Why the `useId` Mismatch Occurred:

This two-phase rendering was the direct cause of the `useId` hydration mismatch. React expects the _very first client render_ to produce an identical component tree to the server-rendered HTML. Because the `useEffect` caused the real RSC content (including `useId` instances) to only appear on a _subsequent_ render, React's initial hydration pass failed. The `useId` seed, which is part of the server's `_R_` script and needs to be consumed during the initial hydration, was missed.

### The Updated Solution: Yielding to the Browser's Parser with `setTimeout`

The core problem remains a race condition: `hydrateRoot` was being called synchronously before the browser's HTML parser could process the inline `<script>` tags that populate `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__` and the React `_R_` state with the `useId` seed. The `rsc-html-stream/client` library correctly sets up a listener, but hydration was starting before any data arrived.

To address this, the `hydrateRoot` call has been wrapped in a `setTimeout(..., 0)`. This defers the execution of `hydrateRoot` to the next tick of the event loop. This brief yield gives the browser's parser enough time to process the immediately available inline `<script>` tags, ensuring that `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__` is populated and `rscStream` has data before React begins its first hydration pass. This approach resolves the race condition without resorting to `DOMContentLoaded`, thus preserving early interactivity for streaming Suspense. Concurrently, the now-redundant `useEffect` workaround in `Content` has been removed to ensure single-pass, correct hydration.

## 49. Definitive Analysis of Server Response and New Strategy for Hydration

My server response and browser DOM inspection reveal critical details about the client-side hydration problem and invalidate previous assumptions.

### Server Response Analysis:

1.  **Absence of `<script id="_R_">`:** Contrary to initial assumptions, the server-rendered HTML **does not** contain a `<script id="_R_">` tag. This means React's internal resumable state, including the `useId` seed, is not being passed via this specific mechanism in my current setup. This invalidates the previous polling strategy that targeted the `_R_` script.
2.  **Timing of `__FLIGHT_DATA__`:** The `(self.__FLIGHT_DATA__ ||= []).push(...)` script is present, but it is positioned **after** the client entry script `import("/src/client.tsx")` in the `<body>`. This is the definitive cause of the race condition.
    - My client entry script executes first.
    - `initClient()` is called, which immediately attempts to set up `rscStream` and call `hydrateRoot()`.
    - At this point, the browser has not yet parsed and executed the `__FLIGHT_DATA__` script.
    - Consequently, `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__` is `undefined` when `rscStream` is initialized, and `hydrateRoot` begins without the necessary RSC payload and `useId` seed.
3.  **`useId` values in DOM:** The server _does_ embed the correct `useId` values (e.g., `_R_76_`) directly into the HTML attributes. The mismatch arises because the client's `useId` counter starts from `_r_0_` due to the lack of the server's seed during its initial hydration attempt.

### Revised Core Problem:

The fundamental issue is that the client entry script (`import("/src/client.tsx")`) executes and initiates `hydrateRoot()` before the `(self.__FLIGHT_DATA__ ||= []).push(...)` script, which contains the critical React Server Component (RSC) payload and the `useId` seed for hydration, has been parsed and executed by the browser.

Given the constraint that `Document.tsx` cannot be altered and the server's explicit placement of scripts, I need a robust mechanism to delay `hydrateRoot()` until `__FLIGHT_DATA__` is populated.

### New Plan: Event-Driven Waiting for `__FLIGHT_DATA__`

Since polling for `_R_` is not applicable and `setTimeout(0)` has proven unreliable, I will implement an event-driven waiting mechanism specifically for `__FLIGHT_DATA__`. The `rsc-html-stream/client` library already overrides `Array.prototype.push` for `__FLIGHT_DATA__`, which I can leverage.

**Strategy:**

1.  **`waitForFlightData` Utility:** Create an asynchronous utility function (`waitForFlightData`) in `sdk/src/runtime/client/client.tsx`. This function will return a `Promise` that resolves when `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__` has received its first push.
    - It will initially check if `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__` already exists and has content. If so, the `Promise` resolves immediately.
    - Otherwise, it will temporarily override `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__.push` to resolve the `Promise` when the first chunk arrives.
    - A `setTimeout` with a reasonable duration will be included as a fallback to ensure the `Promise` eventually resolves, even in unexpected scenarios.
2.  **Integrate with `initClient`:** Modify `initClient` to `await` the `waitForFlightData` `Promise` before proceeding with the `hydrateRoot` call. This ensures that `hydrateRoot` is only invoked once the RSC payload is available.

This strategy directly addresses the race condition, ensuring that React has the necessary server-side state for a correct, single-pass hydration, thus resolving the `useId` mismatch and preserving streaming interactivity.

### The Solution: Separate Initial Hydration from RSC Content Loading

I need a strategy that:

1.  Ensures `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__` is populated before `hydrateRoot` is called (which `waitForFlightData` achieves).
2.  Allows `hydrateRoot` to perform an initial non-blocking hydration of the existing static HTML.
3.  Integrates the streamed RSC content into the React tree _after_ the initial hydration, without blocking the root.

To achieve this, I will restructure the root component passed to `hydrateRoot` to defer the consumption of `rscPayload` into a separate, conditionally rendered child component. This will enable immediate hydration of the static HTML while still correctly handling the streamed RSC content.

## 50. New Issue: `style` Prop Hydration Mismatch

Despite my previous refactoring, a new error emerged during hydration:

`The 'style' prop expects a mapping from style properties to values, not a string. For example, style={{marginRight: spacing + 'em'}} when using JSX.`

### Analysis:

This error occurs because the hydration process attempts to recreate the server-rendered DOM elements using `React.createElement`. When copying attributes from the actual `HTMLElement` (which has a `style` attribute as a CSS string, e.g., `style="padding:2rem"`), React expects the `style` prop to be a JavaScript object (e.g., `style={{ padding: "2rem", fontFamily: "sans-serif" }}`). Directly passing the string value of the `style` attribute causes this type mismatch and hydration failure.

Additionally, a warning `[RSDK] __FLIGHT_DATA__ did not receive data within timeout.` was observed, indicating a potential lingering issue with the `waitForFlightData` mechanism or the timing of `__FLIGHT_DATA__` population.

### Plan:

1.  **Fix `style` prop:** I will implement a utility function `parseStyleString` to convert CSS style strings (e.g., `"padding:2rem;font-family:sans-serif"`) into React-compatible JavaScript style objects (e.g., `{ padding: "2rem", fontFamily: "sans-serif" }`). This function will be used when reconstructing elements for hydration.
2.  **Re-evaluate `waitForFlightData`:** After resolving the `style` prop issue, I will re-investigate the `waitForFlightData` warning to ensure `__FLIGHT_DATA__` is consistently populated.

## 51. Critical Correction: Misunderstanding of React Hydration and Manual DOM Reconstruction

Upon my feedback, it became clear that my previous approach of manually traversing `rootEl.childNodes` and reconstructing the DOM tree with `React.createElement` was fundamentally incorrect for React hydration.

### Incorrect Approach to Hydration:

React's `hydrateRoot` expects a React component tree that represents the structure _expected_ to be in the server-rendered HTML. It is React's responsibility to reconcile this tree with the existing DOM, not for my code to manually rebuild the DOM structure within the `App` component. The children of `#hydrate-root` are already the server-rendered React elements; the client-side `App` component simply needs to define the React tree that `hydrateRoot` should attach to.

### Corrective Actions:

1.  **Reverted Manual DOM Reconstruction:** Removed the `parseStyleString` utility and all manual `React.createElement` calls that attempted to rebuild the DOM from `rootEl.childNodes`.
2.  **Simplified `App` Component:** The `App` component was simplified to directly render `RscStreamContent` within a `Suspense` boundary. This correctly aligns the client-side React tree with the expected server-rendered structure, allowing `hydrateRoot` to perform its intended function of attaching to and making interactive the existing static HTML.
3.  **Next Steps:** The `__FLIGHT_DATA__ did not receive data within timeout` warning still needs to be re-investigated, as the core hydration structure is now corrected.

## 52. `waitForFlightData` Timeout Due to `globalThis` vs. `self` Discrepancy

After correcting the hydration strategy, the warning `[RSDK] __FLIGHT_DATA__ did not receive data within timeout.` persisted. This indicated that the `waitForFlightData` utility was timing out despite `__FLIGHT_DATA__` segments being present in the server response.

### Analysis:

The root cause was a subtle but critical difference in how `__FLIGHT_DATA__` was being referenced. The server-generated inline scripts explicitly use `self.__FLIGHT_DATA__`, and the `rsc-html-stream/client` library uses `window.__FLIGHT_DATA__`. However, the `waitForFlightData` utility was using `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__`.

While `self`, `window`, and `globalThis` often refer to the same global object in a browser's main thread, inconsistencies can arise, particularly in timing or specific execution contexts. By using `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__`, my utility was not reliably observing the modifications (specifically, the `push` override) applied to `self.__FLIGHT_DATA__` by the server's scripts and the `rsc-html-stream` library.

### Plan:

To resolve this, all references to `globalThis.__FLIGHT_DATA__` within the `waitForFlightData` function will be updated to `self.__FLIGHT_DATA__`. This ensures that my client-side waiting mechanism directly monitors the same global variable being modified by the server and the streaming library, thereby correctly detecting when `__FLIGHT_DATA__` has been populated.

## 53. `waitForFlightData` Re-Evaluation: Conflict with `rsc-html-stream` `push` Override

Despite aligning `waitForFlightData` to use `self.__FLIGHT_DATA__`, the timeout warning persisted, indicating a deeper conflict. My observation about `rscStream`'s initialization of `__FLIGHT_DATA__` proved to be the key.

### Analysis:

1.  **`rsc-html-stream` Initialization:** The `rsc-html-stream/client.js` library explicitly initializes `window.__FLIGHT_DATA__` (if it doesn't exist) and then immediately overrides its `Array.prototype.push` method within its `ReadableStream`'s `start` function.
2.  **Conflicting Overrides:** My `waitForFlightData` utility was also attempting to initialize `self.__FLIGHT_DATA__` and override its `push` method. This created a race condition: whichever override happened last would "win." If `rsc-html-stream`'s override occurred after mine, my `cleanup()` callback (which resolves the `waitForFlightData` promise) would never be triggered, because the incoming `__FLIGHT_DATA__` chunks would be handled by `rsc-html-stream`'s `push` method, not the one my utility was watching.
3.  **Consequence:** The `waitForFlightData` utility would consistently time out because it was waiting for a `push` event on a `push` method it no longer controlled.

### Plan:

To definitively resolve this, I will remove the `push` overriding logic from my `waitForFlightData` utility. Instead, I will leverage the `ReadableStream` interface of `rscStream` directly. The revised `waitForFlightData` will:

1.  **Remove `push` Override:** Eliminate the code that attempts to initialize `self.__FLIGHT_DATA__` and override its `push` method.
2.  **Wait for Stream Data:** Obtain a `ReadableStreamDefaultReader` from `rscStream` and `await reader.read()`. This will ensure that `waitForFlightData` resolves only when `rscStream` has actually received and processed its first chunk of `__FLIGHT_DATA__`.
3.  **Retain Timeout:** Keep the existing timeout as a fail-safe, should the stream genuinely fail to produce data.

This approach avoids conflicts with `rsc-html-stream`'s internal mechanisms and directly waits for the data flow through the intended stream, providing a more robust and accurate synchronization point for hydration.

## 55. Definitive Root Cause Analysis: The `TreeContext` Initialization Race Condition

After a rigorous investigation, including detailed analysis of the React source code, the definitive root cause of the `useId` hydration mismatch has been identified. All previous hypotheses related to `bootstrap` options, the presence of an `_R_` script, or the timing of `__FLIGHT_DATA__` were red herrings that pointed to a deeper, more subtle issue.

The problem is a race condition between the initialization of React's internal `TreeContext` on the client and the start of the hydration process.

### The `useId` Seed is the `TreeContext`

The `useId` hook's value during hydration is derived from an internal state object called a `TreeContext`. The investigation into `packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberTreeContext.js` and `packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js` confirmed this.

- **The Context:** The `TreeContext` consists of an `id` (a number) and an `overflow` (a string). Together, these values represent a component's position within the server-rendered tree. This is the "seed" that must be synchronized.
- **The Hydration Logic:** The `useId` hook internally calls `getTreeId()`, which reads from the current `TreeContext`. For hydration to succeed, this context must be identical on the client to what it was on the server.

### The Seed's Serialization and the Implicit Root Suspense Boundary

The crucial question was how this `TreeContext` is passed from the server to the client. The answer is not in a separate script, but embedded directly within the RSC payload stream.

- **Serialization:** The `TreeContext` is serialized as an internal prop, `__treeContext`, on the props of a Suspense boundary. The value is a tuple containing the `id` and `overflow` string. A conceptual example of this in the RSC JSON stream is:

  ```json
  [
    "$",
    "$Sreact.suspense",
    null,
    {
      "fallback": "...",
      "__treeContext": [ 3, "1" ],
      "children": "..."
    }
  ]
  ```

- **The "No Suspense" Case:** As you correctly pointed out, this mechanism must work even if the user has not added a `<Suspense>` boundary. This is because **React's RSC renderer automatically wraps the entire application in an implicit, root-level Suspense boundary.** This root boundary acts as the carrier for the initial `TreeContext` for the whole application.

### The Client-Side Hydration Mechanism

A potential lead about this mechanism was found in `packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHydrationContext.js`:

```javascript
function reenterHydrationStateFromDehydratedSuspenseInstance(
  fiber: Fiber,
  suspenseInstance: SuspenseInstance,
  treeContext: TreeContext | null,
): boolean {
  // ...
  if (treeContext !== null) {
    restoreSuspendedTreeContext(fiber, treeContext);
  }
  // ...
}
```

This code shows that when the React reconciler is hydrating a component that was suspended on the server (a `DehydratedSuspenseInstance`), it looks for a `treeContext` and, if found, uses it to call `restoreSuspendedTreeContext`. This is the function that seeds the client-side `useId` generator to match the server.

### Next Attempt

This complete understanding confirms why our race condition exists and why `setTimeout(0)` is the correct fix.

1.  **The Race:** Our `initClient` function synchronously calls `hydrateRoot`. This happens before the browser has had time to process the initial chunks of the RSC stream, which contain the JSON for the implicit root `Suspense` boundary and its critical `__treeContext` prop.
2.  **The Fix:** Wrapping `hydrateRoot` in a `setTimeout(..., 0)` yields to the browser's event loop. This gives the asynchronous stream parser inside `createFromReadableStream` just enough time to process that initial chunk, create the root `Suspense` element, and allow the reconciler to find the context and call `restoreSuspendedTreeContext` *before* hydration begins.

This is the "just right" moment: it resolves the race condition without waiting for the entire document (`DOMContentLoaded`), thus preserving the critical early interactivity of our streaming architecture.

## 56. Course Correction: Disproving the Implicit Suspense Boundary Theory

The hypothesis in the previous section, stated with undue confidence, was that an "implicit root suspense boundary" was responsible for carrying the `TreeContext` and seeding the `useId` hook. This has been definitively proven **incorrect**.

### Experimental Proof

Through direct instrumentation of the `react-dom-client.development.js` bundle, we have confirmed the following:

1.  **With a `useId` component but no explicit `<Suspense>` boundary:** The `updateSuspenseComponent` function, which is the entry point for hydrating a Suspense boundary and restoring its `TreeContext`, is **never called**.
2.  **With an explicit `<Suspense>` boundary:** The `updateSuspenseComponent` function **is called**.

### Conclusion

This experiment provides conclusive evidence that the `useId` hydration mechanism is **not** dependent on an implicit or explicit Suspense boundary at the root in a non-Suspense scenario. The previous theory was wrong. The fact that `useId` hydration *can* be fixed by delaying execution (e.g., with `DOMContentLoaded`) while the Suspense hydration path is not being used points to a different, more fundamental hydration mechanism that we have not yet identified.

The investigation must return to the source code to find the true source of the initial `TreeContext` during a standard hydration.

## 57. Analysis of Hydration Logs and a Revised Hypothesis

My previous attempts to fix the hydration mismatch by waiting for the RSC stream (`__FLIGHT_DATA__`) were based on an incorrect premise. After instrumenting the React source code directly, the log output provides a much clearer picture of the root cause.

### Log Findings: The Unseeded `TreeContext`

The instrumentation of `react-dom-client.development.js` was conclusive:

1.  **`getIsHydrating()` returns `true`:** The client-side reconciler correctly identifies that it is in hydration mode.
2.  **`getTreeId()` returns an empty string:** This is the critical finding. When `mountId` is called during the initial hydration, the `TreeContext` that backs `getTreeId()` is in its default, uninitialized state. React knows it *should* be using a server-provided ID, but it doesn't have one.
3.  **Client-Side ID Generation:** As a result, the client generates a fresh ID sequence starting from `_R_0_`, which inevitably mismatches the server-rendered `_R_76_`.

The logs prove that the `TreeContext` is never being seeded on the client before hydration begins. My previous belief that the seed was contained within the RSC payload stream appears to be incorrect.

### Revised Hypothesis: The `resumableState` Object

This evidence points back to the server-side rendering process. The initial `TreeContext` for hydration is likely only sent from the server as part of a `resumableState` object. An analysis of React's source code shows this object is only created and sent when the server render is initiated with one of the `bootstrap` options (`bootstrapModules` or `bootstrapScriptContent`).

Our framework's architecture intentionally avoids these options to give the user full control over their `Document.tsx` and script injection. This appears to be the source of the conflict. By not using the `bootstrap` options, I am inadvertently telling the server renderer *not* to generate and send the `resumableState`, which starves the client of the necessary `useId` seed.

### The Next Attempt: A Controlled `bootstrapScriptContent` Experiment

Based on this revised hypothesis, I will re-run the experiment of using `bootstrapScriptContent`. This test failed in the past, but it was likely confounded by other architectural issues that have since been reverted.

This attempt will be more controlled:

1.  I will add `bootstrapScriptContent` to the `renderToReadableStream` call on the server.
2.  To mitigate the risk of the value being trimmed or ignored if it's an empty string, I will use a non-empty value, such as a comment: `'/* rwsdk-hydration-trigger */'`.
3.  I will observe the new log output to see if this change causes the `TreeContext` to be seeded correctly (i.e., if `getTreeId()` now returns a value on the initial mount).

### The Unanswered Question: `DOMContentLoaded`

A significant mystery remains unresolved by this hypothesis. If the missing `resumableState` is the sole cause of the issue, why does wrapping the client-side `initClient` call in a `DOMContentLoaded` listener fix the hydration mismatch? `DOMContentLoaded` waits for the entire document to be parsed, which seems unrelated to the presence of a specific bootstrap script or `resumableState` object. This suggests there may be another mechanism at play, or a more complex interaction that I haven't yet uncovered. This question must be kept in mind as the investigation proceeds.

## 58. `bootstrapScriptContent` Fails Again, Investigation Moves to Server

The controlled experiment with `bootstrapScriptContent: '/* rwsdk-hydration-trigger */'` has failed. The log output is identical to the previous runs: `getTreeId()` still returns an empty string, and the hydration mismatch persists. This provides strong evidence that this option, at least in isolation, does not trigger the serialization of the `TreeContext`.

### Revised Belief and Next Steps

The repeated failure forces a pivot in the investigation. The fact that `DOMContentLoaded` provides a workaround strongly suggests the `useId` seed *is* being delivered asynchronously, but the exact mechanism remains hidden. It is time to follow the execution path of the `bootstrap` options on the server to understand what they do differently.

The new plan is to add logging directly to the React source code on the server-side:

1.  **Trace `createResumableState`:** I will add a log in `packages/react-dom-bindings/src/server/ReactFizzConfigDOM.js` inside `createResumableState` to confirm the `bootstrapScriptContent` option is being received and to inspect the initial state of the `resumableState` object.
2.  **Trace `writeBootstrap`:** I will add a log in `packages/react-server/src/ReactFizzServer.js` inside the `writeBootstrap` function. This is the function responsible for acting on the bootstrap options. Logging the `resumableState` here will show if the option is being correctly passed along and evaluated.

This server-side instrumentation should reveal the branch in logic that I am currently missing, and show what conditions are required for React to serialize its initial hydration state.

## 59. A Critical Realization: The Two-Renderer Architecture

My investigation has been operating on a flawed assumption. I've been focused on the `react-dom/server` implementation, looking for `createResumableState` and trying to understand its `bootstrap` options. However, I failed to account for the hybrid nature of our framework's rendering pipeline.

### The Two Renderers

The core of the architecture, which I had overlooked, is that we use two distinct React renderers on the server:

1.  **The RSC Renderer (`react-server-dom-webpack`):** This renderer is responsible for the first pass. It takes the component tree and serializes it into an RSC payload stream. This stream contains the component data and placeholders for client components.
2.  **The SSR Renderer (`react-dom/server`):** This renderer takes the RSC payload stream from the first pass and renders it into a final HTML stream. This is where the `<Document>` shell is added and where client component placeholders are SSR'd into static HTML.

This clarifies why my attempts to manipulate the RSC renderer might be failing. The `useId` seed required for client hydration is likely generated during the *second* phase—the SSR render—which is handled by `react-dom/server`. The key is that the `bootstrapScriptContent` option is being passed to `renderToReadableStream` from `react-dom/server.edge` in `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream.tsx`, which is the correct renderer. The mystery of why it's not working persists, but my understanding of the system is now more precise.

### The New Plan: Document and Re-evaluate

This realization requires a reset. Before proceeding with more logging or code changes, I need to formalize my understanding of this two-stage rendering process.

1.  **Write Architecture Document:** I will create a new architecture document, `hybrid-rsc-ssr-rendering.md`, to fully explain this process. This will synthesize my verbal explanation, the "message to user" context, and a direct analysis of the code in `sdk/src/runtime/worker.tsx` and `sdk/src/runtime/render/renderRscThenableToHtmlStream.tsx`.
2.  **Re-evaluate `useId` Problem:** With a clear, documented understanding of the rendering flow, I can re-evaluate where the `useId` state might be getting lost.

This architectural deep-dive is now the priority. It will provide the solid foundation needed to form a correct hypothesis and, finally, a correct solution.

## 60. Breakthrough: Server Logs Confirm Hydration Marker Generation

The server-side logs have provided the definitive piece of evidence that was missing. My previous conclusion, based on inspecting the browser DOM, was incorrect.

### Analysis of Server Logs

The logs from `react-dom/server.edge` are conclusive:

1.  The `createResumableState` function correctly receives the `bootstrapScriptContent: '/* rwsdk-hydration-trigger */'` option. The input to the renderer is correct.
2.  The `writeBootstrap` function's internal `bootstrapChunks` confirm that React is assembling and streaming a complete hydration marker script: `<script nonce="..." id="_R_">/* rwsdk-hydration-trigger */</script>`.

This proves that the `bootstrapScriptContent` option is successfully triggering the server to generate the necessary signal for hydration. The state is not missing; it is being sent.

### The Real Root Cause: A Client-Side Race Condition

This evidence pinpoints the true root cause as a client-side race condition. The sequence of events is now clear:

1.  The server streams the initial HTML document. This includes the user-defined client entry script from `Document.tsx`.
2.  The browser parses this and executes the entry script immediately. The `initClient` function is called.
3.  The server, at the end of its rendering process, streams the React-generated `<script id="_R_">`.
4.  The `initClient` function executes and calls `hydrateRoot` *before* the browser has parsed the `_R_` script.
5.  The client-side React runtime initializes, looks for the hydration marker, doesn't find it in the DOM yet, and defaults to client-only mode, causing the `useId` mismatch.

This hypothesis perfectly explains why waiting for the `DOMContentLoaded` event fixes the issue: it is a blunt but effective way to ensure the entire DOM, including the `_R_` script, is parsed before `initClient` runs.

### The Next Attempt: Precisely Waiting for the Hydration Marker

With this understanding, the path forward is to replace the `DOMContentLoaded` workaround with a more precise waiting mechanism. The `initClient` function will be modified to poll the DOM for the existence of the element with the ID `_R_` before calling `hydrateRoot`. This will resolve the race condition without waiting for the entire document to load, thereby preserving streaming interactivity.

## 61. Attempting a Surgical Fix

Based on the conclusive findings from the server logs, the current attempt is a surgical fix that directly addresses the client-side race condition.

The strategy is two-fold:

1.  **Server-Side:** Continue passing `bootstrapScriptContent: '/* rwsdk-hydration-trigger */'` to the SSR renderer. We have confirmed this correctly generates the `<script id="_R_">` hydration marker and streams it at the end of the document.
2.  **Client-Side:** Implement a polling mechanism in `initClient`. This utility will wait for the `document.getElementById('_R_')` to become available before allowing the `hydrateRoot` call to proceed.

This approach is minimal and avoids the complex architectural refactors previously considered. It works with React's streaming behavior by waiting for the precise signal React provides, rather than trying to re-order scripts or take control of the user's `Document`. It is expected to resolve the `useId` mismatch while preserving the early interactivity benefits of our streaming architecture.

## 62. The Polling Mechanism Fails: A Deeper Mystery

The surgical fix of polling for the `<script id="_R_">` element has failed. The hydration mismatch persists, and the client-side logs confirm that `getTreeId()` is still returning an empty string when `mountId` is called.

This is a critical result that invalidates the previous hypothesis. It proves that the mere presence of the `_R_` script in the DOM is not sufficient to seed the client-side `useId` counter. The consumption of the hydration state must be more complex than simply observing the element's existence.

### Re-evaluating the `DOMContentLoaded` Clue

The fact that `DOMContentLoaded` is the only reliable fix remains the most important clue. It strongly suggests that React's hydration mechanism has a dependency that is only met once the *entire* document has been parsed. This could be related to another script, a specific DOM state, or an event that we have not yet identified.

### Next Step: Source Code Investigation

The investigation must go deeper into the React client-side source code. I need to find the exact code path that is responsible for consuming the server-sent hydration state. The next step is to search the React repository for where the `_R_` ID is referenced on the client. By analyzing how and when this marker is supposed to be read, I can determine what conditions are failing in our current setup and why `DOMContentLoaded` resolves them.

## 64. Deep Dive into React's `useId` Hydration Internals

A direct investigation into the React source code has revealed the precise internal mechanism for `useId` generation and hydration, confirming why previous attempts failed and providing a clear path for targeted logging.

### `mountId` in `ReactFiberHooks.js`: The Two Paths

The `mountId` function, which `useId` calls, has two distinct code paths:

1.  **Hydration Path (`if (getIsHydrating())`):** This path is taken when React is hydrating server-rendered content. It constructs the ID using `'_' + identifierPrefix + 'R_' + getTreeId()`. The capital `'R'` and the reliance on `getTreeId()` are specific to this path. This explains the `_R_76_` format from the server.
2.  **Client-Only Path (`else`):** If not hydrating (or if hydration fails and React must re-render), this path is taken. It constructs the ID using `'_' + identifierPrefix + 'r_' + globalClientIdCounter++`. The lowercase `'r'` and the simple incrementing `globalClientIdCounter` are the key identifiers. This perfectly explains the `_r_0_` format we see in the mismatched DOM.

The issue is that our client-side execution is incorrectly falling into the second path.

### `ReactFiberTreeContext.js`: The Source of Truth

The investigation then focused on `getTreeId()`, the function that should provide the server's seed.

- **The State:** `getTreeId()` reads its value from two module-level variables: `treeContextId` (default: `1`) and `treeContextOverflow` (default: `''`). These variables represent the internal `useId` counter state. Their default values explain why `getTreeId()` was returning an empty/default value in our logs.
- **The Seeding Mechanism:** The *only* function that writes to these variables from an external source is `restoreSuspendedTreeContext(workInProgress, suspendedContext)`. This function takes a `suspendedContext` object (containing the `id` and `overflow` from the server) and sets the module-level counter variables.

### The Full Picture: A Race Condition

This provides a complete, end-to-end picture of the mechanism and the bug:

1.  The server renders the page, calculating `useId` values based on its `TreeContext`.
2.  The server serializes the final `TreeContext` and sends it to the client, likely within the RSC payload associated with a Suspense boundary.
3.  On the client, the RSC stream parser should process this payload and trigger the React reconciler.
4.  When the reconciler encounters the Suspense boundary, it should call `restoreSuspendedTreeContext` to seed the client's `useId` counter.
5.  *Only then* should `hydrateRoot` begin, allowing `useId` (via `mountId`) to read the seeded counter and generate matching IDs.

Our application is calling `hydrateRoot` (step 5) before the RSC stream has been parsed and the seed has been restored (step 4), causing the hydration mismatch.

### Next Step: Targeted Logging

To confirm this sequence, the next step is to add logs to `mountId` and `restoreSuspendedTreeContext` in the client's `react-reconciler` bundle. This will allow us to observe the exact order of operations and prove the race condition is the root cause.

## 66. Proof: The Logs Confirm the Race Condition

The logging has provided conclusive, definitive proof of the refined hypothesis. The data gathered from the browser console paints a clear and unambiguous picture of the race condition.

### Analysis of Log Output

1.  **DOM Snapshot Confirms Readiness:** The log of `document.documentElement.innerHTML`, captured immediately before `hydrateRoot` is called, shows the complete server-rendered HTML. Critically, it contains the elements with the correct, high-counter server IDs (`id="_R_76_"` and `id="_R_76H1_"`). This proves that the DOM is fully parsed and available to the client script.
2.  **React Internals Confirm Unseeded State:** The log from within React's `mountId` function is the smoking gun. It shows `[React Log] mountId: Hydrating with treeId -> ` followed by an empty string. This demonstrates that at the exact moment of hydration, React's internal `TreeContext` is in its default, uninitialized state.

### Conclusion

The logs prove the theory correct:

- The server is sending the correct HTML.
- The browser correctly parses this HTML before our client script runs.
- Our client script initiates hydration.
- React, finding its internal `useId` counter unseeded, generates IDs from a fresh counter, causing a mismatch with the server-rendered HTML and leading to a hydration failure.

The problem is not the availability of the DOM, but the initialization of React's internal JavaScript state. Our client script is executing before whatever mechanism is responsible for seeding that state has had a chance to complete. The next phase of the investigation must focus on finding that seeding mechanism and ensuring we wait for it.

## 72. A Paradigm Shift: The Problem is Determinism, Not State Transfer

A breakthrough analysis has completely reframed the problem. The core issue is not a failure of state transfer (i.e., passing a counter from server to client), but a failure of **deterministic rendering**.

### The Correct Mental Model

In a standard SSR application, no state transfer is needed for `useId`. The server renders the component tree, and the `useId` hook generates a sequence of IDs (e.g., `_R_1_`, `_R_2_`). The client then hydrates the *exact same* component tree, and its `useId` hook generates the *exact same* sequence of IDs, resulting in a perfect match.

### The Real Question: Why is Our Rendering Non-Deterministic?

Our application breaks this model. The server is rendering IDs with a high counter value (e.g., `_R_f6_`), while the client starts from a low value (`_R_1_`).

The new, and correct, hypothesis is that **unknown components are calling `useId` during the server render *before* our page component is rendered.** These hidden calls advance the global `useId` counter on the server. The client, which does not render these hidden components, starts its counter from the beginning, leading to the inevitable mismatch. The divergence happens entirely on the server, within the nested rendering pipeline.

### Next Step: Identify the Source of the Divergence

The investigation is no longer about finding a state transfer mechanism. It is now a hunt for the component(s) that are secretly consuming `useId`s on the server. The plan is to add detailed logging to the `mountId` function in the server-side React bundle to trace every single `useId` call back to the component that made it. This will provide a definitive list of all ID consumers and reveal the source of the non-determinism.

## 73. The Divergence Point: `treeContext`

Logging the server-side `useId` calls has provided the final, definitive piece of the puzzle.

### Analysis of Server Logs

- The logs confirm that there are no "hidden" components calling `useId`. Exactly two calls are made on the server, corresponding to the two `useId` hooks in the `UseIdDemo` component. This rules out the theory of unknown ID consumers.
- The critical discovery is the value of the `treeContext` object passed to `useId`. In the server logs, the `treeContext` is already in a highly advanced state (`{ id: 486, overflow: '' }`) *before* the first `useId` call is even made.

### The Inescapable Conclusion

The non-determinism is not caused by extra `useId` calls. It is caused by a divergence in the initial state of the `treeContext` itself. The client render starts with a default `treeContext`, while the server render is starting with a context that has already been advanced by some other process.

The `useId` hook is deterministic; the *input* to the hook is not.

### Next Step: Trace the `treeContext` Initialization

The investigation must now focus on the `treeContext` object. We need to understand what process on the server is manipulating this context before our component renders. The key function to investigate is `pushTreeContext`, which is responsible for advancing the `treeContext` state. The next step is to add logging to the server-side implementation of `pushTreeContext` to build a stack trace of how and why its state is evolving during the server render.

## 74. Confirmed: The Document Render is the Cause

Adding logs to `pushTreeContext` has confirmed the hypothesis.

### Analysis of `pushTreeContext` Logs

The logs show a long series of `pushTreeContext` calls that progressively advance the `treeContext.id` from its initial value of `1` all the way up to `486`. Crucially, all of these calls occur *before* the `useId` hook in our `UseIdDemo` component is invoked.

The stack traces from these logs consistently point to React's internal rendering functions (`renderChildrenArray`, `renderElement`, etc.). This is not an anomaly; it is the standard process of React traversing a component tree.

### The Root Cause: A Shared `treeContext` in a Nested Render

The framework's architecture involves a nested render:

1.  **Outer Shell SSR:** The `renderRscThenableToHtmlStream` function initiates a single server render (`renderToReadableStream`). This render's first job is to process the `<Document>` component, which contains the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. As React renders this document shell, it traverses the tree of elements, calling `pushTreeContext` at each level and advancing the `treeContext` counter.
2.  **Inner Content SSR:** As part of that *same* render, React processes the RSC payload. When it encounters the `UseIdDemo` client component, it begins to SSR it. However, it continues to use the *same, mutated `treeContext`* that was just used to render the document shell. By the time `useId` is called inside `UseIdDemo`, the counter has already been significantly advanced.

The client, on the other hand, only hydrates the inner content. It has no knowledge of the outer document render, so its `treeContext` starts from the default initial state. The mismatch is therefore inevitable and baked into the current rendering architecture.

### The Path Forward: Isolating the Render Context

The problem is now clear: we have a shared, mutable state (`treeContext`) that is not being reset between two logically separate stages of a single technical render. The solution must involve isolating these two stages. An investigation of React's server rendering APIs reveals that the `treeContext` is created once per "request" (a single `renderToReadableStream` call) and there is no public API to reset it mid-stream.

Therefore, the most direct solution appears to be creating a new, separate "request" for the inner content render. This would involve an architectural change to split the current single `renderToReadableStream` call into two, allowing the inner content to be rendered with a fresh, clean `treeContext`.
