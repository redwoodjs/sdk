# Work Log: 2025-09-21 - Chakra UI Playground Implementation

## Brief

Create a comprehensive playground example that demonstrates all major Chakra UI components and APIs within our React server component framework. The playground should:

1. Cover all major Chakra UI component categories (layout, forms, data display, feedback, etc.)
2. Include end-to-end tests that verify components render correctly
3. Ensure no console errors occur during rendering
4. Follow our framework patterns and architecture

The goal is to provide a complete reference implementation showing how Chakra UI integrates with our RSC framework, serving as both a testing ground and documentation for developers.

## Plan

1. Examine the existing hello-world example to understand framework patterns
2. Research Chakra UI component categories and APIs
3. Create a new playground directory structure
4. Implement comprehensive component examples organized by category
5. Set up end-to-end tests to verify rendering and check for console errors
6. Document any integration challenges or framework-specific considerations

## Investigation: Framework Structure Analysis

Starting by examining the hello-world example to understand the framework patterns and structure.

Analyzed the hello-world example and identified key patterns:
- Uses `defineApp` from `rwsdk/worker` for app definition
- Requires `"use client"` directive for interactive components
- Uses `ChakraProvider` wrapper for client-side components
- Document.tsx provides the HTML shell structure
- Components are organized in separate files under `src/app/components/`

## Implementation: Component Categories

Successfully implemented comprehensive Chakra UI component examples organized into 8 major categories:

1. **Layout Components** - Box, Flex, Grid, Stack, Wrap, Center, Square, Circle, Container, SimpleGrid, AspectRatio
2. **Form Components** - Input, Button, Checkbox, Radio, Select, NumberInput, PinInput, Slider, Switch, Textarea
3. **Data Display Components** - Badge, Card, Code, Kbd, List, Stat, Table, Tag, Avatar, Divider
4. **Feedback Components** - Alert, Progress, CircularProgress, Spinner, Skeleton, Toast
5. **Navigation Components** - Breadcrumb, Link, Stepper, Tabs
6. **Overlay Components** - Modal, Drawer, AlertDialog, Popover, Tooltip, Menu
7. **Media Components** - Avatar (extended), Icon, Image
8. **Typography Components** - Heading, Text, Highlight, Mark, responsive typography

Each component category includes:
- Multiple variants and configurations
- Proper data-testid attributes for testing
- Interactive examples where applicable
- Responsive design considerations

## Testing Setup

Created comprehensive end-to-end tests that verify:
- All components render without console errors
- Interactive functionality works correctly
- Component visibility and content validation
- Toast notifications, modals, and other dynamic features

The tests use the framework's e2e testing utilities (`setupPlaygroundEnvironment`, `testDevAndDeploy`, `poll`) to ensure reliable testing across both development and deployment environments.

## Integration Challenges

### Challenge 1: ChakraProvider Client-Side Requirement
Chakra UI requires a provider context that must run on the client side. Solved by creating a separate `ChakraProvider.tsx` component with `"use client"` directive that wraps the Chakra UI provider.

### Challenge 2: Component Organization
With 8 major component categories and dozens of individual components, organization was key. Solved by creating separate component files for each category and using a main Home page that imports and displays all categories.

### Challenge 3: Test Infrastructure
The e2e testing setup initially had path resolution issues when trying to locate the SDK for tarball creation. The test harness was looking for the SDK in the wrong directory path.

## Investigation: `createContext` Error

The dev server fails to start, throwing a `[vite] Internal server error: React2.createContext is not a function`.

This error is consistent with a user report found on Discord, which suggests a problem with how Chakra UI's dependencies are handled by Vite's dependency optimizer.

**Context from User Report:**
- **Discord Link:** <https://discord.com/channels/679514959968993311/1373685754957660283/1412270477744934942>
- **Core Issue:** The user report suggests that `@emotion/react`, a peer dependency of Chakra UI, is being incorrectly included in the RSC (React Server Components) bundle instead of the SSR (Server-Side Rendering) bundle.
- **Hypothesis:** Since `createContext` does not exist in the RSC version of React, the mis-bundling of a library that calls it (`@emotion/react`) leads to the runtime error.

The next step is to investigate Vite's dependency optimization process to understand why `@emotion/react` is being bundled incorrectly and find a way to direct it to the correct (SSR) bundle.
