# Fix CI False Positives and Failing Shadcn E2E Test

## Problem

The CI process for playground E2E tests is reporting success even when tests fail. This is a false positive that hides actual failures.

Separately, the `shadcn` playground E2E test suite has a failing test case related to component interactivity.

## Plan

1.  Correct the CI workflow to ensure it properly reports failures.
2.  Isolate and fix the failing interactivity test in the `shadcn` playground.

## Context

- The `.github/workflows/playground-e2e-tests.yml` workflow file has `continue-on-error: true` for the test step, which is the cause of the false positives.
- The failing test is in `playground/shadcn/__tests__/e2e.test.mts` and concerns checkbox interactivity. The test was using an incorrect selector for shadcn/ui components.
