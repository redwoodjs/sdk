# 2025-09-24: Radix UI Portal Freeze Investigation

## Problem

Users have reported that using components that rely on portals (like those from Radix UI) causes the page to freeze. This investigation aims to create a minimal reproduction of this issue within a controlled playground environment to identify the root cause.

## Plan

1.  **Create a Playground:** Duplicate the `hello-world` playground to a `portal-issue` directory to serve as a baseline.
2.  **Integrate Radix Portal:** Install `@radix-ui/react-portal` and incorporate a basic portal implementation into a client component within the playground.
3.  **Develop an End-to-End Test:** Write a test case that verifies the portal's functionality, which is expected to fail if the freezing issue is present.
4.  **Analysis:** Use the playground to debug and analyze the interaction between our framework and the portal component to understand the cause of the freeze.
