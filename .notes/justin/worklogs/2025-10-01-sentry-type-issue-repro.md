# 2025-10-01 Sentry Type Issue Reproduction

## Problem

A user reported that importing `@sentry/cloudflare` in `src/worker.tsx` causes TypeScript to stop recognizing Cloudflare bindings from `worker-configuration.d.ts`. This seems to be because Sentry's `.d.ts` files include a reference to `@cloudflare/workers-types`, which defines an empty `Cloudflare.Env` interface, shadowing the one augmented by Wrangler.

## Plan

The goal is to create a playground example that reproduces this issue.

1.  Create a new playground example `sentry-type-issue` by copying `hello-world`.
2.  Add a KV binding to `wrangler.jsonc` to have a binding to test against.
3.  Add `worker-configuration.d.ts` with the corresponding type for the KV binding.
4.  Install `@sentry/cloudflare`.
5.  Modify `src/worker.tsx` to import Sentry and use the KV binding. This should trigger the type error.
6.  Update the playground's `package.json` name.
7.  Add an end-to-end test to ensure the application still runs, even with the type error present at build time. The test won't check for the type error itself, but will confirm the app is functional.
