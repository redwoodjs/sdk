# 2025-10-09: Add defineLinks Documentation

## Problem

The `defineLinks` function is a useful utility for creating type-safe links, but it is not documented. This makes it hard for users to discover and understand its purpose.

## Plan

1.  Create a new section in `docs/src/content/docs/core/routing.mdx` called "Generating Links".
2.  Explain the purpose of `defineLinks`: centralized route definition, type safety, and dynamic parameter handling.
3.  Include code examples for each of these points.
4.  Add an API reference for `defineLinks` within the new section.
5.  Keep the style consistent with the rest of the document.
