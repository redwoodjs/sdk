## Problem

A user reported that middleware within a `prefix` block is being applied to routes outside of it, causing unexpected behavior like redirects. The middleware seems to act globally instead of being scoped to its defined prefix, especially when used inside a `layout` function.

## Plan

1.  **Write a Failing Test:** Add a test case to `router.test.ts` that reproduces the bug: a middleware inside a prefixed layout affecting a route in a different prefix.
    -   **Update:** The initial test case passed unexpectedly. This suggests the bug is subtle. While a failing test is ideal, I will proceed with a fix based on a code analysis that points to a design flaw in how `layout` handles middleware.
2.  **Analyze and Fix:** Investigate the `prefix` and `layout` helper functions in `router.ts`. The issue likely lies in how middleware functions are processed and returned when nested within these helpers, causing them to lose their prefix scope.
3.  **Refactor `layout`:** Modify the `layout` function to not just pass middleware functions through, but to associate them with a special property on a `RouteDefinition`. This will ensure middleware stays "attached" to the routes within the layout.
4.  **Update `prefix`:** Adjust the `prefix` function to handle the new structure returned by `layout`, ensuring it correctly applies the path prefix to these attached middleware.
5.  **Verify:** Run the test suite to confirm the failing test now passes and that no existing functionality is broken.
