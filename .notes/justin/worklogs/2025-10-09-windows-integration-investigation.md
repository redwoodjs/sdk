# 2025-10-09: Investigate Windows Integration Issues

## Problem

The SDK has several known issues when running on Windows. These seem to be primarily related to file path handling, leading to errors during development server startup and other filesystem operations. I don't have a Windows machine for testing, which makes debugging these problems difficult.

Known errors include:
- `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`: Node.js's ESM loader receives a path with a drive letter (e.g., `c:`) instead of a `file://` URL. This indicates that absolute paths on Windows are not being correctly converted to file URLs before being passed to `import()`.
- `ENOENT: no such file or directory`: The application attempts to create a directory at a path that appears to have a duplicated drive letter (e.g., `C:\C:\...`). This suggests an issue with path joining or normalization where an absolute path is being incorrectly concatenated with another path segment that includes the drive root.

The goal is to establish a reliable method for debugging the SDK on a Windows environment to identify and fix these and any other platform-specific issues.

## Plan

1.  **Set up a debugging environment**: Create a GitHub Actions workflow that provides a shell on a Windows runner. This will serve as a remote debugging environment.
2.  **Use tmate for SSH access**: The workflow will use `tmate` to create a remote SSH session, allowing interactive access to the Windows runner to run commands, inspect the filesystem, and debug the SDK in a live environment.
3.  **Reproduce the errors**: Once the environment is accessible, the next step will be to run the playground examples or other test cases to reproduce the reported path issues.
4.  **Investigate and fix**: With a reproducible case, I can start debugging the code to find the root cause of the path handling problems and implement fixes. This will likely involve ensuring all path manipulations are handled in a platform-agnostic way, possibly using Node's `path` module more consistently and using `pathToFileURL` from the `url` module where appropriate.

This work log will track the progress of this investigation.

## 2025-10-13: Scripting and Automation Attempts

The initial phase focused on creating a script to automate the process of starting the debug workflow and connecting to the tmate session. Several approaches were attempted:

1.  **Log Scraping (`gh run view --log`)**: The script polled the logs of the workflow run, looking for the SSH connection string. This failed because the `gh` command waits for the run to complete before outputting logs, which it never does while tmate is active.
2.  **Log Streaming (`gh run watch`)**: This improved on the first approach by streaming logs in real time. While functional, it proved to be brittle and sometimes failed to capture the connection string reliably.
3.  **Artifact Upload/Download**: The workflow was modified to save the connection string to a file and upload it as an artifact. The script would then poll for and download this artifact. This method was plagued by a series of platform-specific issues on the Windows runner, including problems with package managers (`scoop`, `choco`), PATH variables, and file system paths, making it unreliable.

Given the time spent on these automation attempts, the decision was made to simplify the script significantly. The new approach is to have the script only trigger the workflow and provide a direct link to the run. The developer can then manually copy the SSH connection string from the logs. This provides a reliable, albeit less automated, solution that allows the primary goal—debugging on Windows—to proceed without further delay. The script will also provide instructions for mounting the remote filesystem locally with `sshfs` for convenience.
