# Resilient Module State Management in Dev

## Problem

The Vite dev server's dependency re-optimization process causes instability in our framework. When a new dependency is discovered during a development session, Vite triggers a re-optimization, which reloads modules. Our framework relies on module-level state (e.g., for `AsyncLocalStorage` contexts in request handling). This reload process discards the existing module instances and creates new ones, effectively wiping out all module-level state. This leads to application crashes and a frustrating developer experience.

While we have implemented a proactive dependency scanning mechanism to minimize the occurrences of re-optimization, it does not eliminate them entirely. Any unforeseen dependency can still trigger a reload and bring down the application. We need a more resilient solution that can withstand these re-optimization events.

## Solution

The proposed solution is to introduce a centralized, virtual state module that is insulated from Vite's re-optimization process. This module will be the single source of truth for all framework-level module state. By marking this module as "external" to Vite's dependency optimizer, we can ensure that its state persists across reloads, even when other application and framework modules are re-instantiated.

This approach offers two primary benefits:
1.  **Dev Server Stability**: It directly solves the state-loss problem during re-optimization, making the dev server more resilient.
2.  **Centralized State Management**: It encourages a more organized approach to state management within the framework. By centralizing state, we make it easier to reason about, debug, and maintain.

### Implementation Details

The implementation will involve creating a new Vite plugin and a dedicated state module.

1.  **Virtual State Module (`rwsdk/__state`)**:
    We will introduce a new virtual module specifier, `rwsdk/__state`. This module will not correspond to a single real file on disk in a way that's directly resolvable by Node or TypeScript, but will be handled by our custom Vite plugin. It will export an API for state management, for instance:
    -   `defineRwState(key, initializer)`: A function to define and initialize a piece of state. It will ensure the initializer is only called once.
    -   `getRwState(key)`: To retrieve a piece of state.
    -   `setRwState(key, value)`: To update a piece of state.

2.  **Physical State Module File**:
    The actual implementation of the state management logic will reside in a physical file, for example, `sdk/src/runtime/state.mts`. This file will contain the state container (e.g., a simple exported `const state = {}`) and the implementation of the state management functions.

3.  **Custom Vite Plugin (`statePlugin.mts`)**:
    A new Vite plugin will be created to manage the `rwsdk/__state` module.
    -   **`configEnvironment` Hook**: This hook will be used to inject a custom `esbuild` plugin into Vite's `optimizeDeps` configuration for the `worker` environment. The `esbuild` plugin's `onResolve` handler will intercept `rwsdk/__state` and mark it as `external: true`. This is the key step to prevent it from being processed and re-optimized by Vite's dependency scanner.
    -   **`resolveId` Hook**:
        -   In **dev mode**, when this hook encounters the `rwsdk/__state` specifier, it will return a virtualized ID (e.g., `virtual:rwsdk:__state`). This signals to Vite that this module requires custom loading logic.
        -   In **build mode**, this hook will resolve `rwsdk/__state` to the absolute path of the physical state module file (`sdk/src/runtime/state.mts`). This allows the module to be bundled normally for production.
    -   **`load` Hook**:
        -   In **dev mode**, this hook will be triggered for the virtual ID. It will read the content of the physical state module file (`sdk/src/runtime/state.mts`) from disk and return it as code. This serves the module's content to the browser/worker without it being part of the dependency graph that `optimizeDeps` is aware of. We can use constants from `sdk/src/lib/constants.mts` to locate this file.

### Example Usage

With this new mechanism, a module like `requestInfo/worker.ts` can be refactored to be stateless. Instead of defining its own module-level state, it will use the centralized state module:

```typescript
// sdk/src/runtime/requestInfo/worker.ts
import { defineRwState } from 'rwsdk/__state';
import { AsyncLocalStorage } from 'async_hooks';

// The initializer function is only called once, and the resulting
// AsyncLocalStorage instance is preserved across re-optimizations.
const requestInfoStore = defineRwState('requestInfoStore', () => new AsyncLocalStorage());

// ... rest of the implementation using requestInfoStore ...
```

This design makes our framework significantly more resilient to Vite's re-optimization behavior during development and improves the overall architecture of state management within the framework.

## Verification Plan: `requestInfo` Playground

To ensure the solution is robust, a new playground example named `requestInfo` will be created. This playground will serve as a dedicated test bed for verifying module state resilience in both development and production environments. It will be based on the `hello-world` template.

### `testDev`: Verifying Resilience to Re-optimization

The primary goal of the `dev` test is to simulate a scenario that would previously have caused a crash: a mid-session dependency re-optimization.

1.  **Setup**: The test will start the dev server and navigate to a page that displays data derived from `requestInfo`. It will also include a component that can be modified to introduce new dependencies.
2.  **Initial State Assertion**: It will first verify that the `requestInfo` data is correctly displayed on the initial page load.
3.  **Dynamic Import Simulation**: The test will then programmatically modify a source file to add new `import` statements. These imports will pull in modules that were not part of the initial dependency graph, forcing a Vite re-optimization. We will test three types of dynamically imported modules:
    *   A module with a `"use client"` directive.
    *   A module with a `"use server"` directive.
    *   A module with no directive.
    *   Each of these modules will, in turn, import a dependency from a local package (similar to the `import-from-use-client` playground) to ensure the dependency graph change is non-trivial.
4.  **Post-HMR Assertion**: After the file modification and subsequent Hot Module Replacement (HMR), the test will verify two things:
    *   The page has been updated to reflect the newly imported components.
    *   The state managed via `rwsdk/__state` (exposed through `requestInfo`) has remained stable and has not been reset. This is the critical validation for the dev server solution.

### `testDeploy`: Verifying Production Build

The `deploy` test will confirm that the state management mechanism works correctly in a production build, where the virtual module is resolved to a standard, bundled module.

1.  **Setup**: The test will build the playground for production and serve the output.
2.  **Assertion**: It will navigate to a page and verify that the `requestInfo` API functions as expected, confirming that the state module is correctly bundled and initialized.

### `testDev`: Verifying Server Action Mutations

To confirm that `requestInfo` can be mutated by server-side logic during a request, another `dev` test will be added.

1.  **Setup**: The test will render a client component containing a form. The form's `action` will be a server action imported from a `"use server"` module.
2.  **Server Action Logic**: The server action will import `requestInfo` and use it to modify the response by setting a custom HTTP header (e.g., `response.headers.set('X-Server-Action', 'true')`).
3.  **Trigger and Intercept**: The test will simulate a user clicking the form's submit button. It will intercept the resulting network request made by the server action.
4.  **Assertion**: The test will inspect the headers of the response from the server action and assert that the custom header was correctly set. This verifies that the `requestInfo` object is mutable within the scope of a server request and can be used to control the response.
