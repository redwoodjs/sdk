## 2025-10-23: LightningCSS Playground Example

### Problem

I need a new playground example to test the integration of `lightningcss`. This will serve as a sandbox for developing and verifying the functionality.

### Plan

1. Create a new playground example named `lightningcss`.
2. Use the `hello-world` example as a template.
3. Update the `package.json` and any other relevant files to reflect the new example's name and purpose.
