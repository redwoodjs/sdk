# 1.0 Triage Plan: 2025-09-08

## Plan / Agenda

The 1.0-beta release has a short timeline, requiring a focused approach to prioritization.

The goal of this session is to triage tasks for the RedwoodSDK 1.0-beta and 1.0 releases. The primary lens for every decision is **perceived stability**: does this task affect the feeling that RedwoodSDK is stable to use in dev or production?

**Core principle**: Prioritize pragmatic, lightweight fixes that address the core of an issue to ensure timely progress.

### Triage Protocol

The triage process is designed to systematically evaluate tasks and produce a structured output for automated processing.

#### 1. Scope and Prioritization
- **Prioritization Strategy**: Only issues expected to affect a large percentage or all users will be considered for `1.0-beta` and `1.0` milestones.
- **New Features**: New feature proposals will be deferred to `future` milestones and will not be considered for `1.0-beta` or `1.0`.
- **Deferred Bugs**: Issues identified as bugs not affecting a large percentage or all users will be labeled `bug` and deferred without a milestone. They will be addressed when capacity allows.

#### 2. Input Sources
The triage process will address three types of inputs from their respective source files:
1.  **GitHub Issues**: Sourced from [`./source-gh-issues.md`](./source-gh-issues.md). These are existing issues from the repository.
2.  **User To-Do List Items**: Sourced from [`./source-todo.md`](./source-todo.md). These are shorthand tasks from the user's notes.
3.  **Missing Tasks**: These are gaps identified during the triage session itself (e.g., security checks, deploy smoke tests).

#### 3. Output
All triage decisions will be recorded in [`./output-issues.md`](./output-issues.md). The triage notes in this file are for internal context to record the rationale behind prioritization.

All general decisions, observations, and key considerations that arise during the process will be continuously recorded in [`./discussion.md`](./discussion.md).

### Release Criteria

- **What "critical stability" means (1.0-beta):**
    - Dev, build, HMR, and deploy workflows cannot hang, crash, or behave unpredictably.
    - Workflows must be smooth for common usage paths (create project, add route, run migrations, deploy).
    - Errors must be clear and actionable. Obscure or misleading errors are blockers because they erode confidence.
    - 1.0-beta must feel usable day-to-day without show-stoppers.

- **What "feels stable" means (1.0):**
    - All 1.0-beta criteria.
    - No critical CVEs impacting users.
    - No known rough edges expected to affect a large percentage of users in common dev/prod workflows.
    - 1.0 should feel polished and confidence-inspiring for new users.

### Labels (Milestones)

These are both labels AND milestones - they determine when work gets done:

- **`bug`**: Identifies an issue as a defect in the code. This label is applied independently of the release milestone.
- **`1.0-beta`**: Issues critical for the beta release. The focus is on essential fixes for bugs that affect a large percentage of users.
- **`1.0`**: Issues that must be fixed for the 1.0 release but are not beta-blocking. Pragmatic solutions are prioritized for bugs that affect a large percentage of users.
- **`future`**: Exploratory, feature work, performance monitoring, and nice-to-haves that can be addressed in a future release post 1.0.
- **`experimental`**: Issues around db, unbundled deps, inline entrypoints, route HMR, CSS in RSC, Vitest, perf checks â€” not yet stable/contracted. Can break.

## Context

This section captures the initial context provided for the triage session.

### Core Challenges
- **The Chicken-and-Egg Problem:** RedwoodSDK lacks broad production usage, where unknown unknowns are typically discovered. However, users won't adopt it until it feels production-ready. We must ground our definition of "stable" in developer perception to break this cycle.

### Key User Pain Points

- **Third-Party Library Compatibility:** Users experience significant friction when using their favorite libraries, particularly component libraries like **ShadCN** and **Base UI**. Issues often arise from stylesheet inclusion and the heavy use of `"use client"` directives. Compatibility issues also surface with other libraries like **Resend**, often due to dependencies that are incompatible with React Server Components (e.g., `react-dom/server`). The general theme is that developers migrating from ecosystems like Next.js expect common libraries to work without significant hurdles.
- **SSR-related Dev Server Instability:** Errors during Server-Side Rendering (SSR) are a major source of instability. These errors can cause the dev server to hang, breaking HMR and forcing a manual restart.
- **Cryptic Error Messages:** When SSR-related crashes occur, the error output is often swallowed, resulting in blank or `undefined` errors. This provides no actionable information for debugging. More broadly, many error messages are terse and could be improved by providing suggestions and links to documentation, especially for common RSC-related issues.
- **Lack of CVE Monitoring:** There is currently no formal process for monitoring or addressing CVEs in project dependencies.
