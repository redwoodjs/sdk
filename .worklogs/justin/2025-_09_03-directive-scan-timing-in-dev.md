This refined approach is surgically precise. It uses the earliest possible hook to guarantee our logic is injected at the correct point, solving the timing issue in a robust and reliable way, all within a single, maintainable plugin.

## 5. Final Strategy: A "Just-In-Time" Scan

The patching strategy, while theoretically sound, proved to be unreliable in practice. The core issue remained that interfering with Vite's internal startup lifecycle is inherently fragile.

The final, successful, and dramatically simpler solution is to abandon patching entirely and run the scan "Just-In-Time."

The insight is that we don't need to preemptively run the scan and then pause other processes. Instead, we can wait until the `client` or `ssr` optimizer *first asks for one of our barrel files*. At that precise moment, we know the scan results are needed, and we can be reasonably certain that the dev server and its environments have been instantiated.

The implementation is as follows:
1.  **Store the Server Instance:** We use the standard `configureServer` hook for one simple purpose: to get and store a reference to the `ViteDevServer` instance.
2.  **Trigger Scan on First Resolution:** We retain the custom `esbuild` plugin that is injected into the `client` and `ssr` optimizers. Its `onResolve` hook still intercepts requests for our barrel files.
3.  **Run Scan Inside `onResolve`:** The first time this hook is triggered, it uses the stored server reference to access `server.environments.worker` and *then* runs the `runDirectivesScan`. A guard ensures the scan is only run once, with subsequent requests awaiting the result of the first scan.
4.  **Generate Barrels and Proceed:** Once the scan promise resolves, the `onResolve` hook generates the barrel content (using the now-populated file sets) and allows the optimization to proceed.

This approach is superior because it eliminates all fragile monkey-patching, relies on stable public APIs, and performs the expensive scan only at the precise moment it is first required. It is simpler, more robust, and more aligned with Vite's event-driven nature.
