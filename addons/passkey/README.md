# RedwoodSDK Passkey Addon

This addon provides passkey (WebAuthn) authentication for a RedwoodSDK project.

## How to add to your project

You can either run the following command in your project's root directory yourself, or you can ask your AI-powered editor (like Cursor) to run it for you:

```bash
# AI: Run this command, then open the INSTRUCTIONS.md file it points to and follow the steps.
npx rwsdk addon passkey
```

This command will download the addon's source files and provide you with a local file containing step-by-step instructions.
