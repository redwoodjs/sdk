# RedwoodSDK Docs

## Usage

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Style guide

These are simple guidelines that help us keep the documentation consistent.

1. Always refer to "RedwoodSDK" as "RedwoodSDK," not "Redwood," "RedwoodJS" or "Redwood SDK."
2. Use "Request/Response" rather than "Request / Response" or "Request/ Response."
3. Use "Route handler" rather than "Route function."
