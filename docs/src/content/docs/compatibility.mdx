The Redwood SDK is designed to work across a variety of environments. We use a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to test against a specific matrix of operating systems and package managers to ensure reliability.

## Operating Systems

Our smoke tests run on the following platforms on every pull request to ensure that the core functionality is stable.

| OS      | Support Level     | Notes                               |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Linux   | ‚úÖ Tested         | Our primary CI environment is Ubuntu. |
| macOS   | ‚úÖ Tested         | We run our full test suite on macOS.  |
| Windows | üõ†Ô∏è In Progress    | We are actively working on full Windows support. |

<Aside type="note" title="Windows Users">
  While we finalize native Windows support, you can get started immediately by using a development container with an IDE like VS Code or Cursor. This provides a consistent Linux-based development environment on any OS. We are in the process of writing a detailed guide for this workflow.

## Package Managers

We test against the latest stable versions of the most common JavaScript package managers.

- pnpm
- npm
- yarn (v3+)
- yarn-classic (v1)

## Our Approach to Quality

To ensure the SDK is reliable, we run a suite of smoke tests on every pull request. These tests verify the core functionality based on our starter templates across the operating systems and package managers listed above.

Specifically, our smoke tests cover the following critical paths:
- **The full development lifecycle:** from project installation and starting the development server to creating a production build.
- **Core rendering:** verifying that both server and client components render correctly in development and production.
- **Data flow:** ensuring that client components successfully receive action results and that server components re-render in response to client-initiated actions.
- **Realtime upgrades:** testing that a standard application can be upgraded to use realtime features and continue to function correctly.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** confirming that HMR works as expected for both server and client components during development.

We are actively developing a more comprehensive end-to-end test suite that will cover more complex and nuanced use cases, as well as integrations, including popular UI component libraries. Our goal is to provide a stable and predictable experience.
