We've baked authentication right into the [**standard starter**](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/tree/main/starters/standard), giving you everything you need to handle users, sessions, and logins out of the box. The standard starter uses **passkeys ([WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide/))** for passwordless authentication (keys can be shared on multiple devices), **session persistence via [Cloudflare Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/)**, and **bot protection with [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/)**. The database layer is powered by **[Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)** and **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)**.

## Setup

Below covers the steps needed to getting authentication working in your **deployments**.

### Wrangler Setup

Within your project's `wrangler.jsonc`:

If you haven't already, replace the `__change_me__` placeholders with a name for your application.

Then, create a new D1 database:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
npx wrangler d1 create my-project-db
```

Copy the database ID provided and paste it into your project's `wrangler.jsonc` file:

```jsonc
{
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "DB",
      "database_name": "my-project-db",
      "database_id": "your-database-id"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used for authentication:

- `WEBAUTHN_APP_NAME`: The application name shown in WebAuthn prompts (defaults to your application name)
- `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID`: The relying party ID for WebAuthn (defaults to the request hostname)
- `AUTH_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for signing session tokens (defaults to a development key in development)

For production deployments, these values are automatically configured by the deployment script. You can override them if needed:

### Customizing WebAuthn Relying Party ID

By default, the RP_ID is set to the hostname of each request. You can override this by setting the `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` environment variable:

```shell
npx wrangler secret put WEBAUTHN_RP_ID
```

When prompted, enter your production domain (e.g., `my-app.example.com`).

Note: The WEBAUTHN_RP_ID must be a valid domain that matches your application's origin. For security reasons, WebAuthn will not work if these don't match.

### Setting up Session Secret Key

For production, generate a strong `AUTH_SECRET_KEY` for signing session IDs:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
# Generate a 32-byte random key and encode it as base64
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Then set this key as a Cloudflare secret:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
npx wrangler secret put AUTH_SECRET_KEY
```

Never use the same secret key for development and production environments, and avoid committing your secret keys to version control.

## Optional: Bot Protection with Turnstile

You can optionally enable bot protection for user registration using Cloudflare Turnstile. To enable this:

1. Visit [Cloudflare Turnstile Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/turnstile).

2. Create a new Turnstile widget:

   - Set **Widget Mode** to `invisible`
   - Add your application's hostname to **Allowed hostnames**, e.g., `my-app.example.com`.

3. Copy your **Site Key** into your application's `LoginPage.tsx`:

```tsx
// LoginPage.tsx
const TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY = "<YOUR_SITE_KEY>";
```

4. Set your **Turnstile Secret Key** via Cloudflare secrets for production:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
npx wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY
```

5. Update your registration function to include Turnstile verification:

```tsx
import { verifyTurnstileToken } from "rwsdk/auth";

// In your registration handler:
const turnstileResponse = await verifyTurnstileToken(token, env);
if (!turnstileResponse.success) {
  throw new Error("Bot protection verification failed");
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Username vs Email

The authentication system intentionally uses usernames instead of emails. This decision prevents enumeration attacks and avoids requiring valid email addresses for registration.

### Authentication Flow

Authentication uses credential IDs from the authenticator instead of usernames or emails, significantly mitigating enumeration risks.

### Bot Protection

When enabled, registration is protected using [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/turnstile/) to prevent automated bot registrations. While Cloudflare's built-in bot detection will identify and block malicious patterns over time, Turnstile provides immediate verification before registration to prevent bot registrations from the start.

## How it all works

### Retrieving a Session

Sessions are handled using **cookies** (for session IDs) and **Durable Objects** (for storing session data).

When a request comes in, we:

1. Check for a **`session_id` cookie**.
2. Verify that the session ID is valid by checking its signature - this lets us be sure it was us that issued it
3. If it's valid, load the session data from the **Durable Object**.
4. If there's an active session, we pull the user ID from it and load the user from the **database ([D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) + [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/))**.

<Code
  lang="typescript"
  title="src/worker.tsx"
  code={importedCodeStandardWorker}
  collapse={"2-17, 19-19, 21-22, 31-31, 33-47"}
/>

#### Why Durable Objects?

Instead of keeping session data in multiple places where we'd have to worry about syncing and stale data, each session is stored in a single **Durable Object** instance. This means we don't have to deal with session data being out of date or lingering after logout—it's all in one place, making revocation straightforward. On top of this, when a session is active, it stays in memory, so lookups are faster without extra database queries.

For more on Durable Objects, see [Cloudflare's documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/).

### Logging In

We use **passkeys ([WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide/))** for authentication. This allows users to log in without passwords, using their authenticator, browser or device to handle authentication securely.

For more on passkeys, see [passkeys.dev](https://passkeys.dev/).

#### Login Flow

1. The user clicks **Login**.
2. The frontend calls a server action to get a WebAuthn challenge.
3. The challenge is stored in the **session store** using `sessions.save()`.
4. The user's authenticator signs the challenge.
5. The signed challenge is sent back to the server and verified.
6. If successful, the session is updated with the **user ID**.

<Code
  lang="typescript"
  title="src/app/pages/user/Login.tsx"
  code={importedCodeStandardLogin}
  collapse={"1-18, 20-24, 41-90"}
/>

<Code
  lang="typescript"
  title="src/app/pages/user/functions.ts"
  code={importedCodeStandardAuthFunctions}
  collapse={"1-109, 111-112, 114-116, 119-169"}
/>

---

### Registering Users

Registration follows a very similar 3-step WebAuthn process as login:

<Code
  lang="typescript"
  title="src/app/pages/user/Login.tsx"
  code={importedCodeStandardLogin}
  collapse={"1-18, 20-41, 64-90"}
/>

One difference: we protect registrations with an extra layer of **bot protection** using [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/).

#### Why Turnstile?

Cloudflare has built-in bot protection, but it works by detecting and blocking malicious patterns over time. That means automated registrations can still get through until Cloudflare picks up on them. Turnstile prevents this from becoming an issue in the first place by requiring a lightweight challenge **before** registration happens, stopping bots at the point of entry.

### Turnstile in the Registration Flow

1. The Turnstile **client script** is loaded on the page.
2. The frontend calls `useTurnstile()` to generate a challenge token.
3. The token is sent to the backend along with the WebAuthn data.
4. The backend verifies the token using `verifyTurnstileToken()` before completing registration.

<Code
  lang="typescript"
  title="src/app/pages/user/Login.tsx"
  code={importedCodeStandardLogin}
  collapse={"1-15, 18-18, 20-22, 24-41, 43-48, 57-62, 64-72, 76-88"}
/>

<Code
  lang="typescript"
  title="src/app/pages/user/functions.ts"
  code={importedCodeStandardAuthFunctions}
  collapse={"1-38, 40-43, 45-46, 55-93, 95-176"}
/>
