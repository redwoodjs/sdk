RedwoodSDK is built to work on the Cloudflare Developer Platform. D1 is Cloudflare's managed, serverless database with SQLite's SQL semantics, built-in disaster recovery, and a generous free tier.

## Setup

You'll need to "bind" your database to your worker (`./src/worker.tsx`). "Binding" implies that there is an external service, like the database, is made available via the `env` object in your worker. You can also bind other services, like KV, Storage, and queues.

In order to bind a database to your worker you'll need to create a D1 database, and save it's configuration details in your `wrangler.jsonc` file.

```bash showLineNumbers=false withOutput
> npx wrangler d1 create my-database

✅ Successfully created DB 'my-database' in region WEUR
Created your new D1 database.

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "my-database"
database_id = "62x40823-4750-4973-b994-fb8fd55xxxx6"
```

We've run a command to create a database called `my-database`. Copy those values and paste them into your `wrangler.jsonc` file. The development server will use the values from your `wrangler.jsonc` file to bind your database to the `env` variable `DB`.

## Usage with Prisma

<Aside type="note" title="Standard Starter">
RedwoodSDK ships with a [Standard starter project](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/tree/main/starters/standard), you can use it to get started with a database in seconds.

```bash frame="none"
npx create-rwsdk my-project-name
```

### Installation

Install the Prisma packages, as well as the adapter for D1, and create a `prisma` directory.

```bash showLineNumbers=false
pnpm install @prisma/adapter-d1 @prisma/client prisma
mkdir prisma
touch prisma/schema.prisma
```

Then modify the `prisma/schema.prisma` file to use the D1 adapter.

```prisma title="prisma/schema.prisma"
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
  output          = "../node_modules/.prisma/client"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

### Migrations

Unfortunately Prisma does not support D1 migrations yet, so you need to use our custom scripts to create and apply migrations.

Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file.

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
    "migrate:dev": "npx prisma generate && wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --local",
    "migrate:prd": "wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --remote",
    "migrate:new": "rw-scripts migrate-new",
}
```

To create a new migration, run `npx run migrate:new "your migration name"`. This will also apply the migration in local development.

To apply migrations, run `npx run migrate:dev` for local development, or `npx run migrate:prd` for production.
