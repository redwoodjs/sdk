<Aside type="caution">
  The [Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quick-start) uses the **minimal
  starter**, you should use the **standard starter** to get you set up and ready
  for using Database, Queues, Sessions and Authentication.

RedwoodSDK is built to work on the Cloudflare Developer Platform. D1 is Cloudflare's managed, serverless database with SQLite's SQL semantics, built-in disaster recovery, and a generous free tier.

<Aside type="note" title="Pick your poison">
  You do not need to use D1, you can use any database you want, but we recommend
  D1.
</Aside>

## Setup

You'll need to "bind" your database to your worker (`./src/worker.tsx`). "Binding" implies that the an external service, like the database, is made available via the `env` object in your worker. You can also bind other services, like KV, Storage, and queues.

In order to bind a database to your worker you'll need to create a D1 database, and save it's configuration details in your `wrangler.jsonc` file.

```bash showLineNumbers=false withOutput
> npx wrangler d1 create my-database

âœ… Successfully created DB 'my-database' in region WEUR
Created your new D1 database.

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "my-database"
database_id = "62x40823-4750-4973-b994-fb8fd55xxxx6"
```

We've run a command to create a database called `my-database`. Copy those values and paste them into your `wrangler.jsonc` file. The development server will use the values from your `wrangler.jsonc` file to bind your database to the `env` variable `DB`.

## Usage with Prisma

<Aside type="note" title="Standard Starter">
RedwoodSDK ships with a [Standard starter project](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/tree/main/starters/standard), you can use it to get started with a database in seconds.

```bash frame="none"
npx degit redwoodjs/sdk/starters/standard#main <project-name>
```

### Installation

Install the Prisma packages, as well as the adapter for D1, and create a `prisma` directory.

```bash showLineNumbers=false
pnpm install @prisma/adapter-d1 @prisma/client prisma
mkdir prisma
touch prisma/schema.prisma
```

Then modify the `prisma/schema.prisma` file to use the D1 adapter.

```prisma title="prisma/schema.prisma"
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
  output          = "../node_modules/.prisma/client"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

### Migrations

Unfortunately Prisma does not support D1 migrations yet, so you need to use our custom scripts to create and apply migrations.

Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file.

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
    "migrate:dev": "npx prisma generate && wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --local",
    "migrate:prd": "wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --remote",
    "migrate:new": "rw-scripts migrate-new",
}
```

To create a new migration, run `npx run migrate:new "your migration name"`. This will also apply the migration in local development.

To apply migrations, run `npx run migrate:dev` for local development, or `npx run migrate:prd` for production.
