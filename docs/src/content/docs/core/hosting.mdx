Cloudflare's Developer Platform provides out-of-the-box access to essential services:

- [Compute](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) (Workers) for serverless functions
- [Database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) (D1) for data storage
- [Storage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) (R2) for files and assets
- [Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/) for background job processing
- & [so much more!](https://developers.cloudflare.com/)

<Aside type="tip" title="Pick your poison">
  You do not need to use Cloudflare's Developer Platform, you can use any
  bare-metal hosting provider you want, but we recommend using Cloudflare's
  Developer Platform!
</Aside>

Not only does Cloudflare have the world's best network, but they also have the best developer experience. When you code locally you're coding against a real environment that is the same as the production environment. This has huge implications for your workflow and productivity, because often "it just works!"

## Deploy to production

Ship your webapp to Cloudflare with the following command:

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash frame="none" showLineNumbers=false
    pnpm release
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash frame="none" showLineNumbers=false
    npm run release
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash frame="none" showLineNumbers=false
    yarn release
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
