Whilst building a webapp you want to be able to respond as quickly as possible to user interactions, but sometimes you need to do things that take a long time! For example, you might need to send an email when a user submits a form, or you need to process a payment, or do something magic with AI - and you don't want the user to wait for these things to complete.

To handle these you'll use **background tasks**. Background tasks are managed by the [Cloudflare queue system](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/). You send a message to a queue, where a worker will process the message, but on a different worker - so it doesn't block the main one.

<Aside type="tip" title="Pick your poison">
  You do not need to use Cloudflare's queue system, you can use any background task system you want, but we recommend
  using queues!

### Setup

First thing you've got to do is create a queue and bind the queue producers and consumers to your worker.

```bash showLineNumbers=false
npx wrangler queues create MY_QUEUE_NAME
```

Replace `"MY_QUEUE_NAME"` with the name of your queue, and place the following in your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

```jsonc title="wrangler.jsonc"
{
  "queues": {
    "producers": [
      {
        "binding": "QUEUE",
        "queue": "MY_QUEUE_NAME",
      }
    ],
    "consumers": [
      {
        "queue": "MY_QUEUE_NAME",
        "max_batch_size": 10,
        "max_batch_timeout": 5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This will bind the queue to the `env.QUEUE` object in the worker. So you'll be able to send messages.

### Sending messages

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx"
export default defineApp([
  route('/pay-with-ai', ({ env }) => {
    // Post a message to the queue
    env.QUEUE.send({
      userId: 1,
      amount: 100,
      currency: 'USD',
    })

    return new Response('Done!')
  })
])
```

### Receiving messages

In order to "consume messages" from the queue you need to change the shape of the `default` export of your worker. You'll add another function called `queue` that will receive a batch of messages.

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx" mark={5-9}

const app = defineApp([ /* routes... */])

export default {
  fetch: app.fetch,
  async queue(batch) {
    for (const message of batch) {
      console.log('handling message' + JSON.stringify(message))
    }
  }
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

This will receive a batch of messages, and process them one by one.
