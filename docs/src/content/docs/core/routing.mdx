title: Request Handling & Routing
description: Like air traffic control, but for requests.

import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The request/response paradigm is at the heart of web development - when a browser makes a request, your server needs to respond with content. RedwoodSDK makes this easy with the `defineApp` function, which lets you elegantly handle incoming requests and return the right responses.

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx"
import { defineApp } from "rwsdk/worker";
import { route } from "rwsdk/router";
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";

export default defineApp([
  // Middleware
  function middleware({ request, ctx }) { /* Modify context */ },
  function middleware({ request, ctx }) { /* Modify context */ },
  // Request Handlers
  route("/", function handler({ request, ctx }) {
    return new Response("Hello, world!")
  }),
  route("/ping", function handler({ request, ctx }) {
    return new Response("Pong!")
  }),
]);
```

---

The `defineApp` function takes an array of middleware and route handlers that are executed in the order they are defined. In this example the request is passed through two middleware functions before being "matched" by the route handlers.

---

## Matching Patterns

Routes are matched in the order they are defined. You define routes using the `route` function. Trailing slashes are optional and normalized internally.

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx" mark={4}
import { route } from "rwsdk/router";

defineApp([
  route("/match-this", () => new Response("Hello, world!"))
])
```

---

`route` parameters:
1. The matching pattern string
2. The request handler function

---

There are three matching patterns:

#### Static

Match exact pathnames.

```tsx
route("/", ...)
route("/about", ...)
route("/contact", ...)
```

#### Parameter

Match dynamic segments marked with a colon (`:`). The values are available in the route handler via `params` (`params.id` and `params.groupId`).

```tsx
route("/users/:id", ...)
route("/users/:id/edit", ...)
route("/users/:id/addToGroup/:groupId", ...)
```

#### Wildcard

Match all remaining segments after the prefix, the values are available in the route handler via `params.$0`, `params.$1`, etc.

```tsx
route("/files/*", ...)
route("/files/*/preview", ...)
route("/files/*/download/*", ...)
```

## Request Handlers

The request handler is a function, or array of functions (See [Interrupters](#interrupters)), that are executed when a request is matched.

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx" mark={4-9}
import { route } from "rwsdk/router";

defineApp([
  route("/a-standard-response", ({ request, params, ctx }) => {
    return new Response("Hello, world!")
  }),
  route('/a-jsx-response', () => {
    return <div>Hello, JSX world!</div>
  }),
])
```

---

The request handler function takes a [RequestInfo](#request-info) object as its parameter.

Return values:
- `Response`: A standard response object.
- `JSX`: A React component, which is statically rendered to HTML on the server, streamed to the client, and then hydrated on the client side.

---

### Interrupters

Interrupters are an array of functions that are executed in sequence for each matched request. They can be used to modify the request, context, or to short-circuit the response. A typical use-case is to check for authentication on a per-request basis, as an example you're trying to ensure that a specific user can access a specific resource.

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx" mark={5-10, 13} collapse={1-2}
import { defineApp } from "rwsdk/worker";
import { route } from "rwsdk/router";
import { EditBlogPage } from "src/pages/blog/EditBlogPage";

function isAuthenticated({ request, ctx }) {
  // Ensure that this user is authenticated
  if (!ctx.user) {
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 })
  }
}

defineApp([
  route("/blog/:slug/edit", [isAuthenticated, EditBlogPage])
])
```

---

For the `/blog/:slug/edit` route, the `isAuthenticated` function will be executed first, if the user is not authenticated, the response will be a 401 Unauthorized. If the user is authenticated, the `EditBlogPage` component will be rendered. Therefore the flow is interrupted. The `isAuthenticated` function can be shared across multiple routes.

---

## Middleware & Context

The context object (`ctx`) is a mutable object that is passed to each request handler, interrupters, and React Server Functions. It's used to share data between the different parts of your application. You populate the context on a per-request basis via Middleware.

Middleware runs before the request is matched to a route. You can specify multiple middleware functions, they'll be executed in the order they are defined.

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx" mark={5-10}
import { defineApp } from "rwsdk/worker";
import { route } from "rwsdk/router";
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";

defineApp([
  sessionMiddleware,
  async function getUserMiddleware({ request, ctx }) {
    if (ctx.session.userId) {
      ctx.user = await db.user.find({ where: { id: ctx.session.userId } });
    }
  },
  route("/hello", [
    function ({ ctx }) {
      if (!ctx.user) {
        return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
      }
    },
    function ({ ctx }) {
      return new Response(`Hello ${ctx.user.username}!`);
    },
  ]),
]);
```

---

The context object:

1. `sessionMiddleware` is a function that is used to populate the `ctx.session` object
2. `getUserMiddleware` is a middleware function that is used to populate the `ctx.user` object
3. `"/hello"` is a an array of route handlers that are executed when "/hello" is matched:
  - if the user is not authenticated the request will be interrupted and a 401 Unauthorized response will be returned
  - if the user is authenticated the request will be passed to the next request handler and `"Hello {ctx.user.username}!"` will be returned

---

## Documents

Documents are how you define the "shell" of your application's html: the `<html>`, `<head>`, `<meta>` tags, scripts, stylesheets, `<body>`, and where in the `<body>` your actual page content is rendered. In RedwoodSDK, you tell it which document to use with the `render()` function in `defineApp`. In other words, you're asking RedwoodSDK to "render" the document.

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx" "document"
import { defineApp } from "rwsdk/worker";
import { route, render } from "rwsdk/router";

import { Document } from "@/pages/Document";
import { HomePage } from "@/pages/HomePage";

export default defineApp([
  render(Document, [route("/", HomePage)])
]);
```

---

The `render` function takes a React component and an array of route handlers. The document will be applied to all the routes that are passed to it.

This component will be rendered on the server side when the page loads. When defining this component, you'd add:
* Your application's stylesheets and scripts
* A mount point for your page content (`id="root"` in the code below): this is where your actual page will be rendered - the "dynamic stuff" which updates using React Server Components.

---

```tsx title="src/pages/Document.tsx" mark={7}
export const Document = ({ children }) => (
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charSet="utf-8" />
      <script type="module" src="/src/client.tsx"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="root">{children}</div>
    </body>
  </html>
);
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Client Side Hydration">
  You must include the client side hydration script in your document, otherwise
  the React components will not be hydrated.
</Aside>

## Request Info

The `requestInfo` object is available in server functions and provides access to the current request's context. Import it from `rwsdk/worker`:

```tsx
import { requestInfo } from "rwsdk/worker";

export async function myServerFunction() {
  const { request, response, ctx } = requestInfo;
  // Use request, response, or ctx as needed
}
```

---

The `requestInfo` object contains:

- `request`: The incoming HTTP [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object
- `response`: A [ResponseInit](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#responseinit) object used to configure the status and headers of the response
- `ctx`: The app context (same as what's passed to components)
- `rw`: RedwoodSDK-specific context
- `cf`: Cloudflare's Execution Context API

You can mutate the `response` object to configure the status and headers. For example:

```tsx
import { requestInfo } from "rwsdk/worker";
import { route } from "rwsdk/router";

const NotFound = () => <div>Not Found</div>;

export default defineApp([
  route('/some-resource', async () => {
    // some logic to determine if the resource is not found
    
    response.status = 404;
    response.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'no-store');

    return <NotFound />;
  }),
]);
```
