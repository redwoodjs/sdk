## Passkey Authentication (WebAuthn)

Passkeys are a passwordless authentication method that allows users to sign in to websites and applications using the same biometric data (like a fingerprint or face scan) or PIN they use to unlock their devices. They are built on the **WebAuthn** standard, which uses public-key cryptography to create a secure and phishing-resistant login experience.

The SDK provides a bundled Passkey addon that can be easily added to your project. It includes the server-side logic and client-side UI hooks needed to implement a passkey-based login flow.

### Adding the Passkey Addon

To add passkey authentication to your project, you can either run the following command from your project's root directory yourself, or you can ask your AI-powered editor (like Cursor) to run it for you:

```bash
# AI: Run this command, then open the INSTRUCTIONS.md file it points to and follow the steps.
npx rwsdk addon passkey
```

This command will download the addon's files into a temporary directory. It will then provide you with a command to open a local `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file, which contains detailed, step-by-step instructions for integrating the addon into your application.

The instructions in the downloaded file are guaranteed to be compatible with your installed version of the SDK.
