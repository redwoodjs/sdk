Our login flow is working great. However, we might run into a situation where someone registers with the wrong email address and we end up with a bunch of unverified users in our database.

To clean this up, we can set up a [cron trigger](/core/cron/) to delete these users after a certain period of time.

## Set up the Trigger

Within our `wrangler.josnc` file, add a new section called `triggers`:

```json title="wrangler.json"
"triggers": {
  "crons": ["0 0 * * *"]
},
```

The `crons` array takes all of our cron schedules. Here, we're using `0 0 * * *` which will run every day at midnight. If we wanted to add another task to run once a month, we would update the array to: `"crons": ["0 0 * * *", "0 0 1 * *"]`.

- The first number says the minute to run.
- The second number says the hour to run.
- The third number says the day of the month to run.
- The fourth number says the month to run.
- The fifth number says the day of the week to run.

A `*` means that the task will run every time that period occurs. So, if you used `* * * * *` it would run every minute.

## Set up the Scheduled Tasks

Now, we need to update our `worker.tsx` file. Let's "save" our `defineApp` function, into a variable called `app`:

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx" showLineNumbers=false
const app = defineApp([
  ...
]);
```

Then, add the following code to the very bottom of the file:

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx" showLineNumbers=false {"1. Set up our App (referencing defineApp)": 2} {"2. Set up the functions we want to run": 4} {"3. Set up a case for each cron schedule, matches our triggers": 7} {"4. Figure out 30 days ago": 11} {"5. Delete the users that are unverified and older than 30 days": 14} {"6. Call the function": 24}
export default {

  fetch: app.fetch,

  async scheduled(controller: ScheduledController) {
    switch (controller.cron) {

      case "0 0 * * *":
        const cleanUnverifiedUsers = async () => {
          console.log("🧹 Clean up Unverified Users");

          const now = new Date();
          const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date(now.setDate(now.getDate() - 30));

          return await db.user.deleteMany({
            where: {
              verified: false,
              createdAt: {
                lte: thirtyDaysAgo,
              },
            },
          });
        };

        await cleanUnverifiedUsers();
        break;
    }
    console.log("⏰ cron processed");
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

<Aside title="cleanUnverifiedUsers function" type="note">
In this code example, I included the `cleanupUnverifiedUsers` function directly within the `scheduled` function. However, you can also move it outside of the `scheduled` function or to a separate file, making your code cleaner and more reusable.
