<Aside type="note" title="Email Providers">
[Resend](https://resend.com/) is one of the most popular email services for developers. It's easy to use and has a generous free tier. But, there are plenty of other wonderful providers: [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/), [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/), and [Mail Trap](https://mailtrap.io/).

## Setting Up Resend

<Steps>

1. Go to [Resend](https://resend.com/) and click on **Get Started** to create an account.

    ![](./images/2-resend-create-account.png)

2. Once you‚Äôve created an account, you‚Äôll be redirected to a page with instructions for sending your first email.

    ![](./images/3-resend-send-first-email.png)

    Create an API key by clicking on the ‚ÄúAdd API Key‚Äù button.

    ![](./images/4-resend-create-api-key.png)

    Copy the API and go to your .env file. Add a variable called RESEND_API and paste your key:

    ``` title=".env"
    RESEND_API=re_1234567890
    ```

    <Aside type="note" title="Environmental Variables">
    If you don't have an `.env` file, you can duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
    </Aside>

    Cloudflare uses a `.dev.vars` file for environment variables. But, the common practice is to use a `.env` file. So, we've created a symlink for you. Anytime you make a change to the `.env` file, it will automatically update the `.dev.vars` file.

    If you're missing the `.dev.vars` file, as soon as you run `pnpm dev`, it will be created for you.

      You can find more information about [Environmental Variables here.](http://localhost:4321/core/env-vars)
    </Aside>

4. Install the Resend package. Within the Terminal, run:

    ```bash
    pnpm add resend
    ```

</Steps>

Your setup is complete! ü•≥ Now, we can send email.

## Sending Email

Now, we can send email.

```tsx title="src/app/auth/actions.ts" showLineNumbers={false}
import { Resend } from "resend";

const resend = new Resend(env.RESEND_API);
const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
  from: "Acme <onboarding@resend.dev>",
  to: email,
  subject: "üëã Hello World",
  text: `Hello World`,
});
```

<Aside type="note" title="Verifying your Domain">
  Until your domain with Resend, there are several important limitations and restrictions to be aware of:

  1. **Sending from Unverified Domains**:
    - You can only send emails from Resend's default addresses (`onboarding@resend.dev`) before your custom domain is verified. Sending from your own domain or branded addresses is not allowed until verification is complete.
  2. **Deliverability and Professionalism**:
    - Emails sent from unverified domains or default addresses are intended only for initial testing. These emails are more likely to be flagged as spam or appear unprofessional to recipients
  3. **Sending Limits**:
    - Free accounts have a daily sending limit of 100 emails per day and a monthly limit of 3,000 emails. These limits apply regardless of whether your domain is verified, but sending from your own domain is only possible after verification.
    - All accounts, including those not yet verified, are subject to a rate limit of 2 requests per second. This can be increased for trusted senders after domain verification and by contacting support.

  You can find more information about verifying your domain on [Resend's documentation](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/introduction).
</Aside>

When using Resend, you can send `text`, `react`, or `html` emails.

### Example: Sending Text Email

```tsx showLineNumbers=false {5} "text"
const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
  from: "Acme <onboarding@resend.dev>",
  to: email,
  subject: "üëã Hello World",
  text: `Hello World`,
});
```

### Example: Sending React Email

```tsx showLineNumbers=false  {1-3, 9} "react:"
const Email = ({ name }: { name: string }) => {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
};

const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
  from: "Acme <onboarding@resend.dev>",
  to: email,
  subject: "üëã Hello World",
  react: <Email name="John" />,
});
```

Resend also backs the [React Email](https://react.email/) project. This library includes unstyled components and the Tailwind CSS support. More under [Email Templates](/guides/email/email-templates).

### Example: Sending HTML Email

```tsx showLineNumbers=false  {5} "html"
const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
  from: "Acme <onboarding@resend.dev>",
  to: email,
  subject: "üëã Hello World",
  html: "<h1>Hello World</h1>",
});
```


## Test Emails

> Resend provides a set of safe email addresses specifically designed for testing, ensuring that you can simulate different email events without affecting your domain‚Äôs reputation.
<cite>[Resend Documentation](https://resend.com/docs/knowledge-base/what-email-addresses-to-use-for-testing#list-of-addresses-to-use)</cite>

A lot of developers will use `@example.com` or `@test.com` for testing. However, these addresses will often reject messages, leading to bounces. A high bounce rate can negatively impact your sender reputation and affect future deliverability. Therefore, Resend will return a `422` error if you attempt to use these addresses.

Instead, Resend provides the following addresses:

| **Address** | **Delivery Event Simulated** |
| --- | --- |
| `delivered@resend.dev` | Email was delivered |
| `bounced@resend.dev` | Email was bounced |

## Constants File

We recommend creating a constants file to store reusable values. Inside your `src/app/shared` directory, create a new file called `constants.ts`.

<FileTree>
- src/
  - app/
    - shared/
      - constants.ts
</FileTree>

Inside the `constants.ts` file, add the following:

```tsx
export const CONSTANTS = Object.freeze({
  FROM_EMAIL: "Acme <onboarding@resend.dev>",
});
```

Now, you can use the `FROM_EMAIL` constant in your code.

```ts showLineNumbers=false {1,4}
import { CONSTANTS } from "~/shared/constants";
...
const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
  from: CONSTANTS.FROM_EMAIL,
  to: email,
  subject: "üëã Hello World",
  text: `Hello World`,
});
```
