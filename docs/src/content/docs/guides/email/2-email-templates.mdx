The [React Email](https://react.email/) project is makes it easy to create email templates. It includes unstyled components and the Tailwind CSS support.

## Installation

Install the React Email components to your project by running the following command in the Terminal:

```bash
pnpm add @react-email/components
```

This assumes that you've already installed `Resend` to your project. If not, you can install the React Email components and Resend in one go:

```bash
pnpm add @react-email/components resend
```

Then, install the React Email Preview:

```bash
npx create-email@latest
```

This will create a new directory called `react-email-starter`.

```bash
cd react-email-starter
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

![](./images/react-email-dev.png)

Now, you can open a browser at http://localhost:3000 and see the preview.

In the left sidebar, you'll notice that React Email has 4 email examples you can preview. These correspond with the `.tsx` files inside the `react-email-starter/emails` directory:

All the assets for these example emails are within the `react-email-starter/emails/static` directory.

You can delete all the contents inside the `emails` directory. Or, oftentimes, I'll create a sub directory called `archive` and move the contents there.

## Creating a New Email Template

<Steps>

1. Create a new file in the `emails` directory with a `.tsx` extension.

2. Inside your email file, paste the following code:

    ```tsx title="src/emails/welcome-email.tsx"
    import {
      Body,
      Container,
      Head,
      Heading,
      Html,
      Preview,
    } from "@react-email/components";

    export default function WelcomeEmail() {
      <Html>
        <Head />
        <Preview>Hello World</Preview>
        <Body>
          <Container>
            <Heading>Hello World</Heading>
          </Container>
        </Body>
      </Html>
    );
    ```

    <Aside type="caution" title="Default Export">
    Your React Email component must be a default export in order for the browser preview to pick it up.
    </Aside>

    You'll notice that React Email has several primitives, making it easy to create a new email template.

    You can see a full list of components on the [React Email documentation](https://react.email/docs/introduction).

    React Email also has several [prebuilt components](https://react.email/components) for [galleries](https://react.email/components/gallery), [e-commerce](https://react.email/components/ecommerce), [articles](https://react.email/components/articles), etc.

3. Adjust the template to your liking.

    Keep in mind that you can pass in props, personalizing the template and making it more dynamic.

    ```tsx title="src/emails/welcome-email.tsx" startLineNumber={10}
    interface WelcomeEmailProps {
      name: string;
    }

    export default function WelcomeEmail({ name }: WelcomeEmailProps) {
      <Html>
        <Head />
        <Preview>Hello {name}</Preview>
        <Body>
          <Container>
            <Heading>Hello {name}</Heading>
          </Container>
        </Body>
      </Html>
    );
    ```

4. When you've finished building the email template, you can get the code by clicking on the Code button in the browser preview.

    ![](./images/react-email-get-code.png)

    From here, you download or copy and paste the React code, HTML, or Plain Text into your project.

    Create a new folder inside the `src/app` directory called `emails` and paste the React Email code into the new file.

    <FileTree>
    - src/
      - app/
        - emails/
          - WelcomeEmail.tsx
    </FileTree>

5. Updating your Resend Code:

    Now, you can update your Resend code (pulled from the example on [Sending Email page](/guides/email/sending-email)) to use the new email template.

    ```tsx title="src/app/emails/WelcomeEmail.tsx"
    import WelcomeEmail from "@/app/emails/WelcomeEmail";

    const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
      from: "Acme <onboarding@resend.dev>",
      to: email,
      subject: "ðŸ‘‹ Hello World",
      react: <WelcomeEmail name="Amy" />,
    });
    ```

</Steps>

## Using Tailwind within Email Templates

<Steps>

1. `import` the Tailwind component at the top of your email template:

    ```tsx title="src/emails/WelcomeEmail.tsx"
    import { Tailwind } from "@react-email/components";
    ```

2. Wrap your email template in the `Tailwind` component:

    ```tsx title="src/emails/WelcomeEmail.tsx" showLineNumbers=false
    <Tailwind>
      <Html>
        <Head />
        <Preview>Hello World</Preview>
      </Html>
    </Tailwind>
    ```

    <Aside type="caution" title="Tailwind Version">
    React Email uses the 3.4.10 version of Tailwind CSS.
    </Aside>

3. If you want to use a custom theme, this will need to be defined as a `config` prop, passed into the `Tailwind` component.

    ```tsx title="src/emails/WelcomeEmail.tsx" showLineNumbers=false
    <Tailwind
      config={{
        theme: {
          extend: {
            colors: {
              brand: "#007291",
            },
          },
        },
      }}
    >
    ...
    ```

    If you go this route, we recommend putting the `config` prop in a separate file, importing it into your email template, and passing it into the `Tailwind` component.

    ```tsx title="src/emails/tailwind.config.ts"
    export default {
      theme: {
        extend: {
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/emails/WelcomeEmail.tsx"
    import tailwindConfig from "./tailwind.config";

    <Tailwind config={tailwindConfig} />
    ```

</Steps>
