In RedwoodSDK, layouts are simply React components that provide consistent structure and styling around your page content. Unlike some frameworks that automatically apply layouts to multiple pages based on file location, RedwoodSDK layouts are explicitly imported and used in each component where needed.

<Steps>
1. Create a layouts directory to organize your layout components:
    <FileTree>
    - src/
      - app/
        - layouts/
    </FileTree>

2. Create a basic layout component:
    ```tsx title="src/app/layouts/MainLayout.tsx"

    export default function MainLayout({ children }:
      {children: React.ReactNode}) {
      return (
        <>
          <Header />
          <main>
            {children}
          </main>
          <Footer />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

3. Use the layout in your page components:
    ```tsx title="src/app/pages/HomePage.tsx"
    import MainLayout from '../layouts/MainLayout'

    export default function HomePage() {
      return (
        <MainLayout>
          <h1>Hello World</h1>
          <p>This is the dream.</p>
        </MainLayout>
      );
    }
    ```
</Steps>

  While we recommend creating a dedicated `layouts` directory, you can organize your layout components however you prefer within your project structure.
