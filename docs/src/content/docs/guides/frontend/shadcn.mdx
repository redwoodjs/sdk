## Installing shadcn/ui

<Steps>
1. Install shadcn/ui
    <PackageManagers
      type="dlx"
      pkg="shadcn@latest"
      args="init"
    />

    It will ask you what theme you want to use.
    ![](../../tutorial/full-stack-app/images/shadcn-neutral-theme.png)

    This command will create a `components.json` file in the root of your project. It contains all the configuration for our shadcn/ui components.

    If you want to modify the default paths so that it will put our components in the `src/app/components/ui` folder.

    ```json title="components.json" startLineNumber={12}
    ...
    "aliases": {
      "components": "@/app/components",
      "utils": "@/app/lib/utils",
      "ui": "@/app/components/ui",
      "lib": "@/app/lib",
      "hooks": "@/app/hooks"
    },
    ```

    <Aside type="note" title="shadcn/ui Organization">
    You'll notice that the `lib` directory is directly inside the `app` directory. You may have to manually move the folder or adjust the import paths when you start adding and using shadcn/ui components.
    </Aside>

2. [Install TailwindCSS](/guides/frontend/tailwind).

3. Now, you should be able to add components:
    You can add components in bulk by running:
    <PackageManagers
      type="dlx"
      pkg="shadcn@latest"
      args="add"
    />

    Or, you can add a single component by running:
    <PackageManagers
      type="dlx"
      pkg="shadcn@latest"
      args="add <COMPONENT-NAME>"
    />

    Components will be added to the `src/components/ui` folder.

    <FileTree>
    - src/
      - app/
        - components/
          - ui/
    </FileTree>
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="React Server Components">
By default, all pages and components within Redwood are server components. However, most of the ShadCN components require reactivity. Therefore, you may need to add `use client` to the top of your component file.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="lib/utils path">
Even though we defined our `lib/utils` directory in the `components.json` file as `"lib": "@/app/lib"`, it may still install the `lib` folder in the `src` directory (or `@`). You'll need to manually move the folder to the `app` directory.

Installing components through the shadcn/ui CLI should use the correct paths. However, if you're copying and pasting code from the shadcn/ui website, you may need to update the import paths.
