## Setup

<Steps>
1. Install Playwright:

    ```bash
    pnpm create playwright
    ```

    This will ask a few questions:

    - **Where to put your end-to-end tests?** If you're already using a **tests** directory for your vitest unit tests, then we recommend playing your Playwright tests within an **e2e** directory.
    - **Add a GitHub Actions workflow**
    - **Install Playright browsers** You can also do this manually, but it's easier to say yes and have the script install it now.

2. Install the Cloudflare plugin for Playwright:

    ```bash
    pnpm i -D @cloudflare/playwright
    ```

3. In your `wrangler.jsonc` file, bind the browser:

    ```jsconc title="wrangler.jsonc"
    "browser": {
      "binding": "MYBROWSER"
    }
    ```

4. Within the `package.json` file, add the following scripts:

    ```json title="package.json"
    "scripts": {
      ...
      "e2e": "playwright test",
      "e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
      "e2e:chromium": "playwright test --project chromium",
      "e2e:firefox": "playwright test --project firefox",
      "e2e:webkit": "playwright test --project webkit",
      "e2e:file": "playwright test",
      "e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug",
      "e2e:codegen": "playwright codegen"
    }

    Below, I'll walk through each of these settings in more depth
