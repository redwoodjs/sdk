Vitest is perfect for running unit or integration tests. However, please note that this setup is only for testing React components.

## Setup

<Steps>
1. Install the following dependencies. Use the `--save-dev` or `-D` flag. These packages will only be used when testing your project during development and don't need to be part of the final production build.

    ```bash
    pnpm i -D @testing-library/dom @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react jsdom vitest
    ```

    - This uses `jsdom` for React component testing, giving a DOM-like environment in Node.js
    - We're using `@test-library` for component and DOM-specific assertions

2. Create a `vite.setup.ts` file in the root of your project.

    ```ts title="/vite.setup.ts"
    import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest';
    ```

3. Create a `vitest.config.ts` file in the root of your project.

    ```ts title="/vitest.config.ts"
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
    import path from 'path';

    export default defineConfig({
      test: {
        environment: 'jsdom',  // Use jsdom for React component testing
        include: ['./test/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}'],  // Test file pattern
        exclude: ['**/node_modules/**'],  // Exclude node_modules
        setupFiles: ['./vitest.setup.ts'], // Setup file
      },
      resolve: {
        alias: {
          '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src')  // Enable @ path alias
        }
      },
    });
    ```

    - This configuration sets up the `@` alias so that if you're using this convention within your components, they will render correctly.
    - You can adjust the `include` property if necessary, but for now, all test files live in the `test/` directory. You'll also need to follow the naming pattern `*.test.tsx` for component tests.

4. Within your `package.json` file, add the following script:

    ```json package.json
    {
      "scripts": {
        ...
        "test": "vitest",
      }
    }
    ```
</Steps>

## Running tests

Now, you can run the following:

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test --watch

# Run specific test file
pnpm test Icon.test.tsx
```
