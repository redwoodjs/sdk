RedwoodSDK is a React framework for **Cloudflare**. It begins as a **Vite plugin** that unlocks **SSR**, **React Server Components**, **Server Functions**, and **realtime features**. Its standards-based router, with support for middleware and interrupters, gives you fine-grained control over every request and response. With built-in access to Cloudflare Workers, D1 (Database), R2 (Storage), Queues, AI, and full local emulation via Miniflare, development feels just like production.

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Quick start" icon="">
    	Create a new project by running the following command, replacing {"<project-name>"} with your project name

    	```bash frame="none"
    	npx degit redwoodjs/sdk/starters/standard <project-name>
    	```

    	Then ["start developing"](/getting-started/quick-start#start-developing)

## Design Philosophy

We believe that the best way to build webapps is to be standards-compliant, to adhere to the request/response paradigm, and to be transparent and composable.

### Standards compliant

We've removed the pain of abstracting away the underlying platform, and instead embraced it. The browser is the primary focus, with the request/response cycle as the foundation.

### Request/Response

The `Request` and `Response` objects are the foundation of the request/response paradigm.
By focusing on these objects, you'll able to seamlessly integrate with the web, streaming responses to the browser, and even build realtime applications.

### Transparent and composable

You are able to follow the flow from request to response, to understand, and modify, how each step is handled.

- No hidden files
- No magic imports / exports
- No generated types
