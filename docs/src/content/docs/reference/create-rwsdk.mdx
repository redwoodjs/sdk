`create-rwsdk` is a command line tool for creating new RedwoodSDK projects

```bash
npx create-rwsdk my-project
```

At Redwood, we try to reduce the magic as much as possible. So, even though we have a command line tool for creating new projects, it's important to us that we share what's happening under the hood.

At it's core, the `create-rwsdk` command looks at the most recent GitHub release, downloads the attached `tar.gz` file, and extracts it to the current directory.

## Usage

```bash
npx create-rwsdk [project-name] [options]
```

#### Arguments

- `[project-name]`: Name of the project directory to create (optional, will prompt if not provided)

#### Options

- `-f, --force`: Force overwrite if directory exists
- `--release <version>`: Use a specific release version (e.g., `v1.0.0-alpha.1`)
- `--pre`: Use the latest pre-release (e.g., alpha, beta, rc)
- `-h, --help`: Display help information
- `-V, --version`: Display version number

### Examples

Create a new project:

```bash
npx create-rwsdk my-awesome-app
```

Create a new project with an interactive prompt for the project name:

```bash
npx create-rwsdk
# You will be prompted: What is the name of your project?
```

Force overwrite an existing directory:

```bash
npx create-rwsdk my-awesome-app --force
```

Create a project from the latest pre-release:

```bash
npx create-rwsdk my-awesome-app --pre
```

Create a project from a specific release version:

```bash
npx create-rwsdk my-awesome-app --release v1.0.0-alpha.10
```

## Next steps after creating a project

```bash
cd <project-name>
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
