RedwoodSDK's router is a lightweight server-side router that's designed to work with `defineApp` from `@redwoodjs/sdk/worker`.

## `route`

The `route` function is used to define a route.

```ts
import { route } from "@redwoodjs/sdk/router";

route("/", () => new Response("Hello, World!"));
```

## `prefix`

The `prefix` function is used to modify the matched string of a group of routes, by adding a prefix to the matched string. This essentially allows you to group related functionality into a seperate file, import those routes and place it into your `defineApp` function.

```ts title="app/pages/user/routes.ts"
import { route } from "@redwoodjs/sdk/router";

import { LoginPage } from "./LoginPage";

export const routes = [
  route("/login", LoginPage),
  route("/logout", () => {
    /* handle logout*/
  }),
];
```

```ts title="worker.ts"
import { prefix } from "@redwoodjs/sdk/router";

import { routes as userRoutes } from "@/app/pages/user/routes";

defineApp([prefix("/user", userRoutes)]);

---
This will match `/user/login` and `/user/logout`
---
```

## render

The `render` function is used to statically render the contents of a JSX element. It cannot contain any dynamic content. Use this to control the output of your HTML.

```tsx
import { render } from "@redwoodjs/sdk/router";

import { ReactDocument } from "@/app/Document";
import { StaticDocument } from "@/app/Document";

import { routes as appRoutes } from "@/app/pages/app/routes";
import { routes as docsRoutes } from "@/app/pages/docs/routes";

export default defineApp([
  render(ReactDocument, [prefix("/app", appRoutes)]),
  render(StaticDocument, [prefix("/docs", docsRoutes)]),
]);
```
