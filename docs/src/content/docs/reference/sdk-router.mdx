RedwoodSDK's router is a lightweight server-side router that's designed to work with `defineApp` from `rwsdk/worker`.

## `route`

The `route` function is used to define a route.

```ts
import { route } from "rwsdk/router";

route("/", () => new Response("Hello, World!"));
```

## `prefix`

The `prefix` function is used to modify the matched string of a group of routes, by adding a prefix to the matched string. This essentially allows you to group related functionality into a seperate file, import those routes and place it into your `defineApp` function.

```ts title="app/pages/user/routes.ts"
import { route } from "rwsdk/router";

import { LoginPage } from "./LoginPage";

export const routes = [
  route("/login", LoginPage),
  route("/logout", () => {
    /* handle logout*/
  }),
];
```

```ts title="worker.ts"
import { prefix } from "rwsdk/router";

import { routes as userRoutes } from "@/app/pages/user/routes";

defineApp([prefix("/user", userRoutes)]);

---
This will match `/user/login` and `/user/logout`
---
```

## render

The `render` function is used to statically render the contents of a JSX element. It cannot contain any dynamic content. Use this to control the output of your HTML.

### Options

The `render` function accepts an optional third parameter with the following options:

- **`rscPayload`** (boolean, default: `true`) - Toggle the RSC payload that's appended to the Document. Disabling this will mean that interactivity can no longer work. Your document should not include any client side initialization.

- **`ssr`** (boolean, default: `true`) - Enable or disable server-side rendering beyond the 'use client' boundary on these routes. When disabled, 'use client' components will render only on the client. This is useful for client components which only work in a browser environment. NOTE: disabling `ssr` requires `rscPayload` to be enabled.

```tsx
import { render } from "rwsdk/router";

import { ReactDocument } from "@/app/Document";
import { StaticDocument } from "@/app/Document";

import { routes as appRoutes } from "@/app/pages/app/routes";
import { routes as docsRoutes } from "@/app/pages/docs/routes";
import { routes as spaRoutes } from "@/app/pages/spa/routes";

export default defineApp([
  // Default: SSR enabled with RSC payload
  render(ReactDocument, [prefix("/app", appRoutes)]),

  // Static rendering: SSR enabled, RSC payload disabled
  render(StaticDocument, [prefix("/docs", docsRoutes)], { rscPayload: false }),

  // Client-side only: SSR disabled, RSC payload enabled
  render(ReactDocument, [prefix("/spa", spaRoutes)], { ssr: false }),
]);
```
