title: API Stability
description: Understanding the stability of Redwood SDK APIs.
---

The Redwood SDK is continuously evolving. To help you understand the maturity of our APIs, we use the following stability levels.

By default, all APIs are considered **Stable** unless explicitly marked with an inline `Experimental` label in the documentation.

## Stability Levels

### Stable

**Stable** APIs are considered ready for production use. We are committed to maintaining backward compatibility for them within a major version, following semantic versioning.

### Experimental

**Experimental** APIs are new or undergoing changes and should be used with caution. They are marked with an inline `Experimental` label directly in the API documentation. These APIs are not subject to semantic versioning, meaning breaking changes can be introduced in any minor or patch release.

## Feature Stability Overview

Here is a high-level overview of the stability of the main feature areas in the SDK:

**Stable Features**
- Vite Plugin
- Routing
- Core App APIs (`defineApp`, `initClient`)
- Authentication & Session Management

**Experimental Features**
- SSR Rendering (`renderToString`, `renderToStream`)
- Client-side Navigation (`initClientNavigation`)
- Database (Durable Objects)
- Realtime
- Turnstile
- Debugging
