## What We're Building and Why

This tutorial is designed for developers who want to learn how to build modern full-stack web applications using RedwoodSDK. Whether you're a frontend developer looking to expand into backend development, or a full-stack developer exploring new tools, you'll learn how to create a complete application from scratch.

At Redwood, we believe AI will revolutionize how people build applications. Personal software has the power to transform our daily lives. Applywise is a perfect example of this transformation - if you're searching for a new job, you need a tool to help manage all your opportunities.

In this tutorial, we'll walk through building Applywize from the ground up, covering everything from database design to user authentication to deployment. While experience with React and JavaScript is helpful, we'll explain core concepts along the way to ensure you can follow along successfully.

All UI designs for Applywize are available in Figma. There, you can view the complete design system, component library, and page layouts. This will help you understand how the final application should look and function before we start building. [Access the Figma design online](https://www.figma.com/design/nqBPIIfe0MO4W8zOfW4oae/Redwood-Reloaded-Tutorial?node-id=1-3&t=9gzbWUrBb2G3qdoa-1) or [download the Figma file](https://github.com/ahaywood/applywize/tree/main/figma).

I've also exported all the images from the Figma file and packaged them together. You can find them [here](https://github.com/ahaywood/applywize/tree/main/assets).

## Technical Prerequisites

Before we start, you'll need:

- A Code Editor. We recommend [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). In fact, the standard starter [ships with Cursor rules](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/tree/main/starters/standard/.cursor/rules) that improves its suggestions.
- A Terminal. We recommend [Warp](https://warp.dev/) or [atuin.sh](https://atuin.sh/).
- Basic knowledge of:
  - JavaScript, TypeScript, and React
  - HTML and CSS
  - Using the command line
  - How databases work (but don't worry, we'll guide you)
