# Experiments

The RedwoodSDK team has built several experiments to validate that we're building something that works. We have moved these out of this repository to increase our development velocity.

- [Streaming Responses (AI Chat)](https://github.com/redwoodjs/example-streaming-ai-chat): An example of an AI chat for showing streaming responses to the UI in RedwoodSDK
- [Realtime notes](https://github.com/redwoodjs/example-realtime-notes): An example usage of RedwoodSDK's realtime APl for a collaborative note-taking webapp
- [Billable](https://github.com/redwoodjs/example-billable): Invoice form to PDF webapp. Workers, Auth, Database (D1), & Storage (R2)
- [Kitchensink](https://github.com/redwoodjs/kitchensink): The "kitchensink" implements all the interesting parts of RedwoodSDK. This is primarily used for demoes.
- [Drizzle](https://github.com/redwoodjs/example-drizzle): RedwoodSDK usage with Drizzle.
