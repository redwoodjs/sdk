# Redirect in Actions

This playground example demonstrates redirecting from action handlers by throwing Response objects with redirect status codes.

## Features

- Form action that redirects after successful submission
- onClick action that redirects
- Error handling for validation failures

## Running the dev server

```shell
npm run dev
```

Point your browser to the URL displayed in the terminal (e.g. `http://localhost:5173/`). You should see a demo page with form and button actions that redirect to a success page.
