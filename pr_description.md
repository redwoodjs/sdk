Okay, I've added the context comment and updated the architecture documentation.

Here is the pull request description you requested:

### Description

This addresses a critical build failure that occurred during the final "linker" pass of the production build process.

#### The Problem: Duplicate Identifier Collision

Our multi-phase build process culminates in a linker pass where the main `worker` bundle is combined with a separately-built `ssr` bundle. Both of these are pre-compiled and minified artifacts. During this final step, Vite's `esbuild-transpile` plugin would fail with a `duplicate identifier` error (e.g., `The symbol "l0" has already been declared`).

The root cause is how Rollup merges modules. When combining the two pre-bundled artifacts, it places them in a shared top-level scope. Because both bundles were independently minified, they could contain identical, short variable names (`l0`), leading to a redeclaration error. The bundler cannot safely rename these identifiers because the semantic context of the original source code is lost in a pre-compiled artifact.

#### The Solution: Scope Isolation via Exporting IIFE

The solution is to modify how the `ssr` bundle is generated, making it a "good citizen" that can be safely imported by another bundle.

We've updated the SSR build configuration to wrap its entire output in an exporting Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE). This is achieved using Rollup's `banner` and `footer` options, combined with a small inline plugin to remove the original `export` statement from the bundle's content.

The resulting artifact is a valid, tree-shakeable ES module that exports its members from an isolated scope. This prevents any internal variable names from colliding with the parent `worker` bundle, resolving the build failure while preserving the benefits of static analysis.

### Testing

The production build now completes successfully.
